## Setup

Run targeted checks while iterating. Before handing off a task, run the
repository's fast guardrail gate:

```bash
make ci-fast
```

The full `make ci` workflow is the canonical PR merge gate and runs in CI.

## Website

The website is independent of the Rust workspace.

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

`npm run build` syncs the architecture mirror before building.

## Orbit State

Review `.orbit/` changes carefully before committing. Tracked asset changes are product changes. Mutable runtime artifacts are operational data unless the change is intentional.
