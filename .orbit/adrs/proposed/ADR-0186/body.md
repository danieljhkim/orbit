## Context
With incremental sync, a file's symbol rows are deleted and re-inserted on change. If cross-file refs FK to `symbols.id`, every incremental rebuild orphans inbound refs from other files. The current `orbit-knowledge` schema has an `identity_key` column trying to paper over this; it doesn't fully work and adds complexity.

## Decision
No foreign key on `symbols.id` from any table. Refs and relations resolve by `target_qualified` (string lookup). A `target_symbol_hint INTEGER` column exists as a build-time cache but is non-authoritative.

## Consequences
- Incremental sync is correct by construction: dropping a file's symbols doesn't dangle anything.
- No `identity_key` column or cross-build lineage tracking machinery.
- Cost: **string lookups instead of integer FK joins.** SQLite's B-tree on `target_qualified` keeps this fast (low single-ms even on 100k symbols), but it's a real cost compared to the natural FK design. Rename tracking is a separate feature on top of git, not a graph affordance.
