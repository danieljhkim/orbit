# The output sink is the only place in orbit-cli that asks whether stdout is a
# terminal, how wide it is, or whether color is permitted
# (docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/output-modes.md §1, ADR-0306). A
# command that re-derives any of it renders differently from the sink that
# resolved the invocation, which is the drift the sink exists to remove.
#
# command/log/tail.rs is the one grandfathered exception: it colorizes a
# streamed tail from a local `is_terminal()` check, and a dependent task in the
# staged migration removes it. Nothing may be added to the allowlist without
# that being a decision.
