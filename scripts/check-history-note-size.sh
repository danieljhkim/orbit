# Task history notes must not inline bulk. [ORB-10343]
#
# Measurement over 845 task bundles found that every history entry above 2 KB
# was a `workflow_run_failed` note carrying a run's whole `error_message` — 9
# entries holding 16.6% of all history bytes in the workspace, one of them
# 85 KB. Every reader of that task pays for the blob: Daniel scanning history,
# memory distillation, triage, and every agent whose task context is built from
# the same note (`v2_host/task_context.rs`).
#
# The fix is a single cap in `orbit-engine`'s `context::outcome`, which keeps the
# head of the message and points at `orbit run show <run_id> --json` for the
# rest. That is lossless because `job_run_steps.error_message` already persists
# the full text — the note was a duplicate.
#
# This guard exists because the failure mode is silent: a new failure writer that
# formats its own note, or a second copy of the threshold, reintroduces the blob
# and nothing else notices until history is fat again. The runtime bound itself
# is pinned by crates/orbit-engine/src/context/tests/outcome.rs; this script
# pins the structural invariants that no unit test can see.
#
# Re-measure any time with: scripts/measure-history-signal.py
