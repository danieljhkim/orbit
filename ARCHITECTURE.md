The diagram highlights the dependency edges that define the principal layering
boundaries; [`scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh`](scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh)
is the exhaustive crate-edge contract.

Layering constrains dependency direction. Domain crates own their data and
transport concerns; application layers compose them with runtime kernels.
Kernel crates expose reusable mechanisms and never depend back on a vertical
feature.

## Crates

- **orbit-types**: lowest internal contract crate — no Orbit deps. Domain-qualified modules (`identity`, `workspace`, `task`, `workflow`, `policy`, `resource`, `tool`, `telemetry`, `record`) own shared serde contracts, pure constructors, normalization, and narrow domain errors. `OrbitId` is the only crate-root primitive. This crate does not perform filesystem, process, environment, database, network, logging, or tracing work.
- **orbit-common**: mechanism crate above `orbit-types`. Owns workspace-wide `OrbitError`, governance (`authorization`, `operation`, `friction`), filesystem/path helpers, process support, storage, protocol/YAML codecs, observability, and security (redaction plus `security::child_env`, the single
  allowlist-based builder for agent-subprocess environments that `orbit-config`
  parameterizes with `[execution.env]` and every subprocess launcher applies to a
  cleared environment). Operation registries still live here so every consumer surface can read them without a new dependency edge; the matching handler table lives in `orbit-core` and is joined to it by the noun's verb enum. MCP v1 explicitly defers capability decisions inside Core while retaining ordinary domain and sandbox validation.
- **orbit-config**: owner of `config.toml`. Fixed-key admission registry, global-over-workspace layering with replace-only security keys, source provenance for `orbit config show`/`get`, resolved views (`ResolvedConfig`, execution/env policies, crew registry, persistence paths, config-owned PR settings), comment-preserving `ConfigStore` edits with atomic save, and default-config seeding. Callers pass an explicit `ConfigRoots`, so the crate performs no cwd or `$HOME` discovery; host provider-CLI detection and interactive prompting stay in the `orbit-cli` init adapter, which hands down a `ConfigSeed`. Depends only on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common`, and deliberately not on `orbit-engine` — Core translates `PrSettings` into `orbit_engine::PrConfig` at composition time.
- **orbit-policy**: filesystem-scoping policy engine. Owns `FsProfile` resolution and `denyRead` / `denyModify` evaluation. Depends on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common`.
- **orbit-exec**: process / sandbox / supervision primitives for shell-command execution under an `FsProfile`. Depends on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common`.
- **orbit-search**: retrieval and ranking feature crate. Owns lexical docs/ADR scoring, the `Embedder` trait, JSON-Lines RPC types, `SubprocessEmbedder`, `NoopEmbedder`, the workspace-local vector store (`vector::VectorStore` with its own `rusqlite::Connection`, WAL + busy_timeout pragmas, idempotent `embeddings` / `corpus_fts` schema, `EmbedWorker`, paragraph chunker, BLAKE3 dedup, BM25, cosine, and reciprocal-rank fusion helpers), and the install/uninstall/reindex/stats `commands::*` surface. Depends on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common` for its library surface; does not depend on `orbit-core` or `orbit-store`.
  Retrieval and ranking live in `orbit-search`. `orbit-core` owns the domain (corpora, records, lifecycle) and projects records into search-source structs. `orbit-search` owns lexical (BM25), semantic (cosine), and hybrid scoring. CLI verbs are presets layered on the same backend.
  It also builds `orbit-search-companion`, a separately installed search companion binary, as an additional `[[bin]]` target (folded from the standalone `orbit-search-companion` crate, ORB-10357); that target alone depends on fastembed-rs and is not linked into the default `orbit` CLI binary.
- **orbit-registry**: machine identity and workspace registry feature crate. It
  owns `host.toml`, the logical workspace catalog and local checkout bindings,
  validation, and atomic file persistence. It contains no shared database,
  command orchestration, MCP transport, or Core runtime execution. Depends only
  on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common` among workspace crates.
- **orbit-store**: one directional persistence crate. `contracts` owns every
  consumer-visible trait, parameter, query/filter, and result projection;
  `fs` owns narrowly named lock, path-safety, and YAML mechanics; private
  `driver/file` and `driver/sqlite` modules implement exactly one persistence
  technology each. `repository` owns live invariants that join drivers (task
  bundles + registry indexes + checkout projections, and friction SQLite +
  file taxonomy). `workflow` owns explicit import/export/reindex/repair and
  layout-upgrade operations. `compose` constructs concrete implementations and
  returns contract-facing stores. The crate retains the namespaced feature
  migration ledger and immutable historical bootstrap migrations. It depends
  on `orbit-types` and `orbit-common`; the semantic vector schema remains owned
  by `orbit-search::vector`.
- **orbit-tools**: generic tool registry plus built-in fs, policy-aware exec, and workspace-scoped Orbit definitions. It depends on `orbit-types`, `orbit-common`, `orbit-exec`, and `orbit-policy`; MCP composes these with its machine-local discovery definitions.
- **orbit-mcp**: Model Context Protocol feature crate using `rmcp`. It owns stdio framing, advertised-name translation, per-call trace creation, structured responses, canonical tool discovery, server identity presentation, the TCP listener transport, and the direct SSH stdio proxy. Registry supplies machine-local facts and Tools supplies definitions whose only routing metadata is global versus workspace-required scope. The CLI-owned host resolves server-local workspaces; Core owns domain validation, auditing, and the future authorization boundary.
- **orbit-web**: HTTP API, embedded dashboard UI, and remote web connection. It owns axum handlers/assets, dashboard mutations, and the dashboard-specific SSH local-forward lifecycle. Depends on `orbit-core` for runtime-backed operations and projections and on `orbit-registry` for global workspace discovery; consumed by `orbit-cli` via `web serve` and `web connect`. Public surface is `ServeArgs`, `ConnectArgs`, and their serve/connect entry points.
- **orbit-agent**: per-provider `AgentRuntime` implementations under `providers/<name>/<name>_runtime.rs` (claude, codex, gemini, gemini_http, grok, openai_compat, anthropic, ollama, mock_agent). Provides the CLI agent runtimes Orbit dispatches, plus a standalone HTTP `LoopTransport` / `AgentLoop` SDK surface with its own examples — Orbit's job execution no longer reaches that loop ([ORB-10801]). Depends on `orbit-types`, `orbit-common`, and `orbit-tools`.
- **orbit-engine**: activity/job execution, template rendering, retry logic, subprocess execution, and tool-aware automation. Owns the CLI agent subprocess runner (`activity_job::cli_runner`), which references `orbit-agent::{Agent, AgentConfig}` directly so orbit-core stays clean of orbit-agent types. Depends on `orbit-agent`, `orbit-types`, `orbit-common`, `orbit-exec`, `orbit-store`, and `orbit-tools`.
- **orbit-core**: directional application/runtime composition and metrics. Its
  `runtime` module owns stores, eventing, audit, claims, reservations, tool and
  process execution mechanisms, and construction from an already-resolved
  `orbit-config` value. `application` owns shared use-case DTOs and coordinated
  operations. `adapter` owns Orbit-tool and engine-host protocol translation;
  `bootstrap` owns initialization, managed defaults, policy seeding, and
  forward-only startup migrations; `composition` is the only module that joins
  those pieces and loads resolved configuration. The enforced internal graph is
  `runtime <- application <- adapter`, with `composition -> config + bootstrap
  + runtime + adapters`. Runtime production code may not import `application`
  or a former `command` module, and application production code may not import
  adapters. Core exposes `OrbitRuntime` to `orbit-cmd`, `orbit-cli`, and
  `orbit-web`; it does not depend on transport/presentation crates,
  `orbit-agent`, or `orbit-cmd`.
- **orbit-cmd**: shared application composition for CLI and Web consumers. It owns CLI-facing command groups plus registry-aware runtime and routine assembly, joining `orbit-core` kernels to `orbit-registry` without reversing either lower-layer dependency. Runtime methods are exposed as per-module `*Commands` extension traits.
- **orbit-cli**: clap-based entry point and local client-configuration surface. It assembles MCP, Registry, Web, and Core. `mcp serve` and `mcp listen` compose one host and serve it over stdio or TCP; `mcp serve --mode remote` delegates only the byte-transparent SSH process to `orbit-mcp`. In every case the accepting machine resolves local state and dispatches through Core.

## orbit-store internal direction

```mermaid
flowchart BT
  File["driver/file"] --> Contracts["contracts"]
  File --> Fs["fs primitives"]
  Sqlite["driver/sqlite"] --> Contracts
  Sqlite --> Fs
  Repository["repository"] --> File
  Repository --> Sqlite

```

The file and SQLite drivers are private and never import one another. Shared
atomic-write, advisory-lock, path-safety, and YAML mechanics belong to `fs`,
not to a backend-shaped utility module. Checkout projection and workspace
binding YAML are file behavior even though registry rows are SQLite-backed.

Live task writes are committed by the composite task repository: canonical
bundle durability is the file-driver operation, allocation/binding/index rows
are the registry-driver operation, and `.orbit/tasks` symlinks are disposable
checkout projections. The drivers do not call each other. Task archive
import/export/reindex, friction Markdown import/SQLite export, legacy audit and
job-run import, and workspace layout upgrades are explicit `workflow` modules.
In particular, constructing a friction repository does not perform a hidden
Markdown import; `compose::workspace_friction_store` invokes the idempotent,
transactional workflow before opening the live repository.

[`scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh`](scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh)
enforces these source-level arrows in addition to crate-level edges. It rejects
implementation or `rusqlite` imports from contracts, cross-driver imports, and
driver imports of repositories/workflows. Concrete construction and migration
access stay in composition, bootstrap, and maintenance adapters; ordinary
application code consumes the contract traits and DTOs.

## Stability tiers

Each workspace crate declares a stability tier in its `Cargo.toml` under `[package.metadata.orbit]`. `scripts/check-stability.sh` (wired into `make ci`) fails closed if a crate is missing the marker or sets a value outside the allowed set. The current contract is marker-only — no automated public-API diff — but the tiering exists to make refactor scope explicit for reviewers.

- **stable** — Public-ish surface. Breaking changes need conscious owner sign-off. (No automated diff today; this is intent-signalling only.)
- **experimental** — Free to refactor; downstream crates depend at their own risk.
- **internal** — Refactor freely; no external/downstream guarantees.

| Crate                 | Tier         |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| orbit-types           | stable       |
| orbit-common          | stable       |
| orbit-config          | internal     |
| orbit-store           | stable       |
| orbit-registry        | internal     |
| orbit-agent           | internal     |

|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tasks           | WorkspaceOnly      | Per-repo backlog, no cross-project leaking       |
| Activities/Jobs | MergeByKey         | Global defaults + workspace overrides            |
| Policies        | MergeByKey         | Workspace overrides profiles by name; global `denyRead` / `denyModify` rules accumulate |
| Job Runs        | WorkspaceOnly      | Execution artifacts are workspace-local          |
| Skills          | MergeByKey         | Global defaults in `~/.orbit/skills`; workspace overrides by skill name |
| Command Audit   | GlobalOnly         | Single authoritative SQLite event trail          |
| Semantic Index  | WorkspaceOnly      | Task-derived embeddings stay with the workspace  |
| Run Traces      | WorkspaceOnly      | Per-repo activity/job JSONL and blob artifacts   |
| ADR/Learning IDs | Shared allocator + worktree-local bodies | ID rows live in shared `.orbit/state/semantic.db`; body files live in the current worktree so they can be staged with code |
