# Automation: the sweep clock and routines

How scheduled work happens, and what to turn on. A fresh workspace has the whole
automation layer installed and **switched off** — this is the reference for
opting in deliberately.

## The chain

```text
OS clock unit (every minute)
  └── orbit sweep                       stateless: what is due on this host?
        └── routine (.orbit/routines/*.yaml)
              └── job:<name>            runs as a normal, auditable run
```

Four things must all be true for a routine to fire:

1. This host has a clock unit installed (or something invokes `orbit sweep`).
2. The workspace declares itself a routine source.
3. The routine's `enabled:` is true and this host is in its `hosts:` list.
4. The routine is not paused on this host.

## Turning the scheduler on

**1. Install the host clock.**

```bash
orbit routine init --install-clock
```

Reads the machine identity written by `orbit init` and installs the per-user OS
clock unit that runs `orbit sweep` every minute — launchd on macOS, a systemd
user timer on Linux. It never creates or rewrites host identity; `orbit init`
owns that.

```bash
orbit routine clock status          # cadence and native manager state
orbit routine clock pause|enable    # host-wide, without touching routine state
orbit routine clock set <minutes>   # whole-minute cadence, reloads the unit
```

`clock pause` stops scheduled invocation; a manual `orbit sweep` still works.

**2. Make the workspace a routine source.** In `.orbit/config.toml`:

```toml
[routines]
role = "source"
```

`source` is the only supported value; anything else is a fail-closed config
error. `orbit sweep` loads definitions from every registered workspace carrying
this, and ignores workspaces that don't.

**3. Enable routines, one at a time.** Each is a versioned YAML file — flipping
`enabled: true` is a reviewable commit, not a runtime toggle.

## The five seeded routines

`orbit workspace init` seeds all five, **all disabled**, with the host pin and a
workspace-unique name (`<base>-<workspace>`) resolved at seed time. Run
`orbit routine list` to see their actual names on this host.

| Base name | Cadence | Target | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `worktree-gc` | hourly | `worktree_gc_pipeline` | Reclaims worktrees whose task settled to done, rejected, or archived. |
| `task-pilot` | every 4h | `task_pilot_pipeline` | Preflights proposed/backlog tasks with empty `context_files` and fills in validated selectors. |
| `task-triage` | hourly | `task_triage_pipeline` | Diagnoses tasks blocked by failed runs; re-backlogs environmental casualties, leaves real failures blocked with a diagnosis. |
| `auto-task-scheduler` | every minute | `auto_task_scheduler_pipeline` | Mints tasks from every due, enabled auto-task definition. → [auto-tasks.md](auto-tasks.md) |
| `ship-sweep` | every 20m | `workspace_ship_pipeline` | Ships this workspace's ready backlog through the gated pipeline, unattended. |

The minutely cadence on the auto-task scheduler is intentional: each definition
carries its *own* schedule, so the routine just has to tick often enough not to
delay them. Per-definition cursors and catch-up collapse keep it cheap.

## Recommended enablement order

Enable in this order and stop wherever the value runs out. Each step is safe
without the ones after it; **the reverse is not true.**

1. **`worktree-gc` first.** It is the only one that reclaims disk, and every
   other routine here creates runs that leave worktrees behind. Turning on
   scheduled shipping without GC is how a workspace fills a disk. Watch one
   cycle with `orbit gc worktrees --dry-run` before enabling. →
   [maintenance.md](maintenance.md)
2. **`task-pilot`.** Read-only, and it makes everything downstream safer:
   populated `context_files` are what conflict detection and file reservation
   use to keep parallel runs off each other's files.
3. **`task-triage`.** Cleanup, not a hot path. Worth having before unattended
   shipping, so a failed run gets diagnosed instead of silently sitting blocked.
4. **`auto-task-scheduler`**, once at least one auto-task definition is enabled.
   With no enabled definitions it is a no-op every minute — harmless, but
   pointless.
5. **`ship-sweep` last, and only deliberately.** This is the one that commits,
   pushes, and opens PRs without a human present. It also needs
   `workflow.auto_ship = true`. Do not enable it in the same change as anything
   above; let the earlier ones prove themselves against real traffic first.

## Authoring a routine

Only a `job:` target is accepted — an `activity:` target is rejected, so wrap a
single activity in a one-step job.

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
name: <routine-name>              # unique across every routine source on the host
enabled: true                      # versioned kill-switch
hosts: [<host-id>]                 # explicit pinning; there is no "any host"
trigger:
  cron: "0 22 * * *"              # 5-field, host-local time
  missed_run: skip                 # skip | catch_up_once
target: job:<job-name>
policy:
  timeout_minutes: 10
  retries: { max: 2, backoff_minutes: 2 }
  overlap: forbid                  # forbid | allow
```

Parsing is fail-closed: an invalid file — bad schema version, unknown field,
unresolvable target, unparsable cron — makes *that routine* absent and reports a
load error. It never fires with defaults.

Consult `orbit routine --help` for the full field schema before hand-authoring
one. Don't answer field semantics from memory.

## Verify without firing

```bash
orbit routine list                 # every routine: enabled / pinned / paused, next due
orbit routine show <name>          # definition, effective state, recent fires
orbit sweep --dry-run              # what would fire; records and dispatches nothing
orbit sweep --dry-run --verbose    # include not-due rows
```

## Observe and control

Fires are ordinary runs — they appear in `orbit run history` under the actor
`routine/<name>`.

```bash
orbit routine pause <name>         # this host only; survives reboots
orbit routine resume <name>
```

## "Why didn't it fire?"

Resolve the toggles in this order — `orbit routine list` shows all three at once:

1. `enabled: false` in the definition (versioned, affects every host).
2. This host is not in the routine's `hosts:` list (versioned, per host).
3. A local pause (this host only, unversioned, durable across reboots).

If none of those explain it, check further out: is the workspace declared a
routine source, is the clock unit running (`orbit routine clock status`), and did
the sweep itself error (`orbit log tail --level warn --since 1h`)? For a fire
that started and then failed, the run is the evidence —
