# Remote access, federation, and caller permissions

Remote access reads or operates the accepting host's live store. It does not
replicate tasks. First identify the owning host and workspace; see
[multi-host.md](multi-host.md) for owner/replica setup and
[publication.md](publication.md) for offline snapshots.

## Direct and federated MCP

```bash
orbit mcp serve --workspace <workspace-id>
orbit mcp serve --mode remote <ssh-host>
orbit mcp serve --mode federated
```

Local stdio is what a client launches. Remote mode relays one non-interactive,
non-PTY SSH connection to a destination Orbit. Federated mode combines the local
host with configured SSH destinations into one tool surface. There is no
`orbit mcp connect` command; use `serve --mode remote`.

For federation, put remote membership in the calling machine's
`~/.orbit/mcp-destinations.toml`:

```toml
[[destinations]]
ssh = "<ssh-config-alias>"
machine_id = "<destination-machine-id>"
```

Copy machine IDs from `orbit host show` on the corresponding hosts. Local
membership is automatic and needs no row. Missing/empty configuration gives a
local-only mux; malformed or ambiguous configuration fails closed. A configured
unreachable destination remains visible in discovery rather than disappearing.

```bash
orbit mcp init --federated --client codex
```

This creates a separate client integration and preserves the ordinary one.
Federation is session-unbound: call `orbit_workspace_list` and pass each
returned host-qualified `selector` unchanged. Do not pass `--workspace` or a
positional SSH destination to federated mode. On a direct server, a session
binding via `--workspace` is valid, and explicit per-call selectors take
precedence. `--root` is not an MCP workspace-routing mechanism.

## Authority on the destination

Bare local `serve` and ordinary `mcp init` are agent-only.
`workspace init --mcp` deliberately installs a local operator integration.
On SSH, a request for operator capability is capped by the destination's
`~/.orbit/mcp-callers.toml`; the caller cannot grant itself that authority.

```bash
orbit mcp callers list
orbit mcp callers check <caller-machine-id>
orbit mcp callers init
```

`init` seeds known callers with agent grants only. Operator grants are deliberate
operator edits on the destination. For example:

```toml
default = "deny"

[[callers]]
machine_id = "<caller-machine-id>"
label = "<display-name>"
capabilities = ["agent", "operator"]
workspaces = ["<allowed-workspace-id>"]
```

`default` accepts `agent` or `deny`, never `operator`. A missing callers file
means agent by default. `workspaces` optionally narrows a row to specific logical
IDs. Effective permissions are the intersection of the requested capability and
the destination grant, with ordinary tool policy still enforced. A malformed
file fails closed. Inspect the check result and session audit evidence when a
workflow tool is absent or denied; do not treat changing remote argv as a fix.

There are two identity strengths. Ordinary SSH proxy identity is a self-asserted
audit label, suitable for cooperative operators with shell access; it is not
proof against a caller naming a different machine. Key-bound acceptance uses a
forced command generated on the destination:

```bash
orbit mcp callers authorize --machine-id <caller-machine-id> \
  --key <public-key-path> --launcher <protected-orbit-launcher>
```

This prints configuration; it does not install it. The protected path requires
a dedicated Linux login account, a root-managed `AuthorizedKeysFile`, per-key
environments enabled, and a root-owned mode-2555 setgid Orbit copy configured as
that account's login shell. The launcher must match the running Orbit binary and
use a group different from the account's primary group. Follow the installed
command's help and host administration procedure; an ordinary shell wrapper is
not equivalent. Refresh the protected launcher after binary upgrades. Do not
infer verified identity merely from a configured key fingerprint: inspect the
recorded identity proof.

## Dashboard

```bash
orbit web serve --no-open
orbit web serve --port 8080 --no-open
orbit web connect <ssh-host>
orbit web connect <ssh-host> --remote-port 7878 --port 9000
orbit web connect <ssh-host> --root <remote-workspace-path>
```

The default dashboard port is 7878. `connect` reuses an existing remote loopback
server when available; otherwise it starts one and owns that process's lifetime.
The browser offers workspace selection, task detail and lifecycle controls,
run/step inspection, routines, knowledge/frictions, audit, and metrics. Verify the
selected workspace before any mutation; a dashboard aggregate or metric is not
proof that a particular task or run succeeded.

The dashboard refuses non-loopback binds and has no application login. Its
Origin checks mitigate browser CSRF, not unauthorized port access. Anyone with
access to its forwarded port can reach mutation endpoints with the server's
application authority. Keep access within the intended operator boundary.

## TCP MCP

```bash
orbit mcp listen
orbit mcp listen 0.0.0.0:7879 --allow-non-loopback
```

Default is loopback port 7879. The socket authenticates no client; use a protected
network path such as an SSH tunnel. Non-loopback exposure is an explicit choice,
not a remedy for a missing capability. SSH caller-policy configuration does not
turn a raw TCP socket or dashboard into an authenticated per-user service.
