//! Regression guard for the `workflow_run_failed` history note.
//!
//! Measurement over 845 task bundles (ORB-10343) found that every history entry
//! over 2 KB was a `workflow_run_failed` note inlining a run's whole
//! `error_message` — 9 entries carrying 16.6% of all history bytes. These tests
//! pin the bound so that surface cannot silently return to inlining bulk.
