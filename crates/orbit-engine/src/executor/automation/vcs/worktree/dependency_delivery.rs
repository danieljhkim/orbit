//! Does a done dependency's work actually exist in the base this run will be
//! cut from?
//!
//! Lifecycle admission (`admit_task_for_workflow_as_system`, orbit-core) only
//! asks whether a dependency reached `done`. F2026-07-038 showed that is half
//! the question: ORB-10201 was admitted with dependency ORB-10203 done, but
//! its worktree was cut from `agent-main` at `0a7f7676`, which does not
//! contain ORB-10203's commit `76ded2c9` — the dependency branch existed
//! locally and remotely and had simply never merged. The run therefore started
//! from the exact stale content its dependency had already corrected, and
//! nothing in the pipeline noticed.
//!
//! Readiness means both halves: lifecycle completion *and* delivery into the
//! effective base. This module answers the second one from local Git history
//! alone — no GitHub API — so a PR-backed dependency and a locally committed
//! one are verified the same way, and the check works in a repo with no remote
//! at all.
