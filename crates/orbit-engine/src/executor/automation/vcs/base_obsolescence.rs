//! Can a delivery against this base branch still reach the branch work lands
//! on?
//!
//! A resumed PR pipeline used to report success against a base that had
//! already merged and been deleted (ORB-10644). Every step passed — the base
//! name flows `input.base_branch -> prepare_branch -> sync_base -> pr_open`
//! and was never re-derived — because `resolve_worktree_start_point` is
//! satisfied by any `origin/<base>` that resolves, and a leftover or restored
//! branch resolves to its pre-merge tip. The PR then opened against a branch
//! nothing merges any more, so the commit never landed while every signal said
//! it had.
//!
//! # What "obsolete" means here
//!
//! A base is obsolete when it can no longer carry work to the landing branch,
//! by either of two tests:
//!
//! 1. **Deleted.** The repository has an `origin` remote and the base branch no
//!    longer exists on it. A PR cannot merge into a branch the remote does not
//!    have, so a local (or stale remote-tracking) ref that still resolves is a
//!    leftover, not a target.
//! 2. **Already landed.** A `landing_branch` was declared, differs from the
//!    base, and the base carries nothing the landing branch does not already
//!    have: either the base tip is an ancestor of the landing branch (merge /
//!    fast-forward), or every commit unique to the base is already delivered on
//!    the landing branch under its task marker (squash / rebase — the shape
//!    Orbit's own `merge_batch_pr` produces, where the sha is rewritten and only
//!    the marker survives).
//!
//! Test 2 deliberately reuses `delivery_marker`, the same reasoning
//! `worktree::dependency_delivery` uses for "is this actually merged into
//! base", rather than a parallel rule.
//!
//! # False positives
//!
//! Test 2 flags a live base whose only unique commits repeat a task id that
//! already landed (a task re-opened and re-run, or work folded into a sibling
//! task under the same id). Test 1 flags a base kept deliberately local while
//! an `origin` remote exists. Both are refusals of work that could have
//! shipped; both are escapable with `input.base_obsolescence='ignore'`. The
//! trade is deliberate — the failure this replaces is silent, and a loud
//! refusal is recoverable in a way a "successful" non-delivery is not.
//!
//! The gate stays inert for ordinary delivery: with no `landing_branch`
//! declared, or with the landing branch equal to the base (the overwhelmingly
//! common non-stacked case), only the cheap remote-existence probe runs.
