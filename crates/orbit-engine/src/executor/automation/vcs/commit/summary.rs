//! ORB-10603: a deterministic execution summary derived from the delivered change.
//!
//! Delivery refuses to hand off a task whose durable execution summary is empty
//! (see [`reject_failed_delivery`](super::super::handoff::reject_failed_delivery)),
//! and the only writer of that field was a prose instruction asking the
//! implementing agent to persist one. Agent-loop output is advisory, so every
//! run where the agent skipped the instruction wedged at commit.
//!
//! This module closes the gap without touching either end of the contract. It
//! never reads the agent's returned envelope — the summary is derived from the
//! worktree change this step is about to deliver, which is durable state any
//! reviewer can re-check with `git status` before the commit or `git show
//! --stat` after it. It also never overwrites a summary the agent did persist:
//! an agent-authored account of the work is the better artifact and wins.
//!
//! ADR-0326 records the decision and the alternatives it rejected.
