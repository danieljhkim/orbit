//! `collect_ci_evidence` — host-owned CI discovery.
//!
//! An implementation agent cannot query GitHub from inside its sandbox: the
//! `github.*` builtins run `gh` as a child of the executing process, and the
//! lane denies the CLI's credential directory and forwards no token. The
//! problem disappears entirely if the host does the looking *before* any task
//! exists, and writes what it found into the task description.
//!
//! This stage sits on the same engine-private automation boundary as
//! `automation::vcs`: `NoSandbox`, inherited environment, engine-private
//! labels, never advertised to agents, and outside public tool authorization
//! and activity allowlists. No new agent-facing tool is added and no GitHub
//! credential becomes visible from inside a sandbox. What leaves this module
//! is one bounded, redacted JSON snapshot — no token, no host configuration,
//! and no way to run another query.
//!
//! Four endings stay distinct here and are never allowed to collapse into one
//! another or into a clean pass: [`OUTCOME_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`] (we could
//! not look), [`OUTCOME_NO_CURRENT_FAILURE`] (we looked and nothing is
//! failing), [`OUTCOME_CURRENT_FAILURES`] (we looked and something is), and
//! [`OUTCOME_RETRYABLE_ERROR`] (a bounded discovery or investigation failed).
