//! The GitHub CLI surface, without the tool registry wrapped around it.
//!
//! The `github.*` builtins are how an *agent* reads CI state: they build a
//! `gh` argv, project its JSON into stable field names, and bound and redact
//! anything log-shaped on the way back out. Engine-private deterministic
//! automation needs exactly the same argv, the same projections, and the same
//! bounding — but it runs on the host, outside any agent sandbox, and must not
//! route through `ToolRegistry`, tool authorization, or an activity allowlist.
//!
//! Rather than let a second copy of the GitHub CLI contract grow in
//! `orbit-engine`, this module re-exports the pieces. `orbit-tools` stays the
//! single owner of what a `gh` invocation looks like and of how its output is
//! made safe to carry; callers here own the policy question of when to run it.
//!
//! Every request builder returns an [`ExecRequest`] with `current_dir: None`.
//! Set it to the repository the query is about before executing — `gh`
//! otherwise resolves the repository from the caller's working directory.
