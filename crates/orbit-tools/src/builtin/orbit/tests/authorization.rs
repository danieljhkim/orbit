//! Guardrail: the governed-operation registry names real tools [ORB-10453],
//! and every governed tool's MCP placement is declared [ORB-10478].
//!
//! `GOVERNED_OPERATIONS` is declared in `orbit-common`, which sits below the
//! tool registry and so cannot check itself against it. The registry is keyed by
//! string, so a renamed or deleted tool would silently stop being governed —
//! the failure mode is a *disappearing* guard, which no behavioural test
//! notices because nothing starts failing. This is the test that does.
//!
//! It is also the one place both axes are visible at once. Placement (which
//! surfaces list a tool) lives in the tool registry; permission (who may
//! perform it) lives in `orbit_common::authorization`. Neither crate can check
//! the pairing alone, so the invariant is asserted here rather than left to a
//! reader holding two files open. `orbit-tools` is the lowest crate that sees
//! both, so this needs no new dependency edge.
