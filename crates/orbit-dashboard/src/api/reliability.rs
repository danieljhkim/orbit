//! `GET /api/metrics/reliability` — pipeline reliability across workspaces
//! [ORB-10588].
//!
//! Reports two rates the dashboard previously could not answer at all: how
//! often job runs fail, and how often the recovery path fires. Both come from
//! [`OrbitRuntime::pipeline_reliability`], which reads only persisted
//! `job_runs` / `invocations` rows — no token or cost field is on the path.
//!
//! This handler takes the whole [`DashboardState`] rather than the [`Ws`]
//! extractor, following [`super::workspaces`]: a failure spike is only
//! attributable if the operator can see which workspace it came from. Each
//! workspace is reported separately and a `totals` block sums the counts;
//! rates in `totals` are recomputed from the summed counts rather than
//! averaged, so a small workspace cannot skew the headline.
//!
//! [`Ws`]: crate::state::Ws
//! [`OrbitRuntime::pipeline_reliability`]: orbit_core::OrbitRuntime::pipeline_reliability
