//! Bounded, diagnostic advisory file locking shared by the SQLite ID allocator
//! and the file-backed learning/ADR stores. [ORB-00412]
//!
//! ID allocation and learning/ADR record mutation serialize through `fs2`
//! advisory (`flock(2)`) locks. A bare [`fs2::FileExt::lock_exclusive`] blocks
//! *indefinitely*: if a holder hangs — as opposed to crashing, since the OS
//! releases advisory locks on process death — every other agent stalls forever
//! with no signal about who holds the lock or why. Under concurrent
//! multi-agent use (planning duels, parallel worktrees, unattended
//! ship-sweep) that silent stall is a whole-workspace availability risk.
//!
//! This module bounds the wait with a configurable deadline, records holder
//! metadata (PID + acquisition timestamp) into the lock file for diagnostics,
//! and emits a `tracing::warn!` once a waiter has been blocked past a
//! threshold. Holder metadata is advisory only — the OS `flock` is the source
//! of truth; the metadata is read solely to enrich the error/warning a blocked
//! waiter reports. A clean guard drop clears the metadata while still holding
//! the flock, while an abrupt process death leaves it behind as a crash signal.
//!
//! The returned [`FileLockGuard`] follows the RAII-guard pattern
//! (`docs/design-patterns/raii_guard.md`): the OS lock is released when the
//! guard is dropped, including on `?`-return and unwind.
