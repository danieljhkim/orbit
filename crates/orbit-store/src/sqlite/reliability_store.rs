//! Count-only reliability reads over `job_runs` and `invocations` [ORB-10588].
//!
//! These queries exist so pipeline-reliability reporting never has to load the
//! wide row shapes that the token/cost metrics path uses. Every column read
//! here is an identifier, a state, or a timestamp: no token column and no cost
//! column is referenced, projected, or aggregated. That is deliberate — the
//! worker run store and `invocations` disagree on token accounting by an order
//! of magnitude (friction F2026-08-031), so any rate derived from those fields
//! would be confidently wrong. Durations and counts do not share that defect.
//!
//! Both queries are workspace-scoped. `job_runs` carries `workspace_id`
//! directly; `invocations` does not, so it is scoped by joining each
//! invocation back to the run that produced it. An invocation whose owning run
//! is absent from `job_runs` is therefore excluded rather than attributed to an
//! arbitrary workspace.
//!
//! Windows are half-open (`since <= ts < until`) and compared as RFC3339 text,
//! matching every other timestamp filter in this crate (see
//! `list_job_runs_for_workspace` and `list_invocation_records`).
