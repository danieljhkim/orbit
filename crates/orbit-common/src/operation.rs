//! Operations-as-data kernel — ADR-0209 bearing 1 [ORB-10358].
//!
//! An *operation* is one verb on one noun (`friction add`, `friction list`).
//! This module lets a noun declare each of its verbs exactly once, as data:
//! the wire name, the parameters, how each parameter binds to the CLI, whether
//! MCP exposes the verb, and how the CLI renders the result. Consumer surfaces
//! then *derive* their wiring from that declaration instead of restating the
//! verb once per surface.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! The kernel is deliberately transport-agnostic and runtime-agnostic: it holds
//! no clap types, no axum types, and no `OrbitRuntime` handle, so it can live in
//! the leaf crate where every surface can read it. Each surface owns its own
//! translation:
//!
//! | Surface          | Derives                                            |
//! |------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `orbit-tools`    | `ToolSchema` + MCP exposure policy from the spec    |
//! | `orbit-cli`      | `clap::Command` + input JSON + audit metadata       |
//! | `orbit-web`      | tool names + request→input projection               |
//! | `orbit-core`     | the handler table, keyed by the verb enum           |
//!
//! Handlers need `&OrbitRuntime`, which lives above this crate, so the handler
//! table cannot live next to the spec table. The two halves are joined by the
//! noun's verb enum: the spec table is `&'static [OperationSpec<V>]` here, and
//! the handler table is one exhaustive `match` on `V` in `orbit-core`. The
//! compiler rejects a verb that has a spec but no handler.
//!
//! See `docs/design/operations-as-data/` for the migration cookbook.
