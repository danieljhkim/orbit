//! Deterministic child environments for agent subprocesses.
//!
//! An agent subprocess is untrusted and keeps host network access, so its
//! environment is *composed from an allowlist* rather than filtered out of the
//! parent process. The distinction is the whole point of this module: a
//! denylist admits every name nobody thought to forbid, so a benignly named
//! credential (`DATABASE_URL`, an internal service URL, a per-team
//! `BILLING_ENDPOINT`) reaches the provider CLI even though the operator
//! configured `inherit = false`.
//!
//! Admission control here is therefore membership in an explicit set of names:
//! the documented baseline below, the operator's configured pass list, the
//! extras a provider declares it requires, and Orbit's own `ORBIT_*`
//! execution-envelope namespace. Credential-name and value-shape heuristics
//! are deliberately *not* consulted — they cannot classify names an operator's
//! environment actually uses, and treating them as a gate is what let the
//! bypass exist.
//!
//! [`inherited_child_env`] is the explicit opt-out for an operator who really
//! does want full inheritance.
