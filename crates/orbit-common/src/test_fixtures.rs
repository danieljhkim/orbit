//! Frozen model-name constants for tests.
//!
//! These keep test fixtures, attribution values, and snapshots stable and
//! independent of the production defaults in [`crate::model_defaults`]. The
//! values are intentionally *frozen* at the literals that were hardcoded
//! before centralization, so mechanical fixture/snapshot data does not churn
//! when production defaults change.
//!
//! Guidance:
//! - A test that asserts on a **default fallback or seeded output** should use
//!   the production constant from [`crate::model_defaults`] (its expected value
//!   tracks the real default).
//! - A test where the model is **mere input or attribution** (who authored a
//!   task/comment, an arbitrary `--model` pass-through) should use one of these
//!   frozen constants so the fixture value never changes.
//!
//! Exposed behind the `test-util` feature so integration tests in sibling
//! crates — which cannot see another crate's `#[cfg(test)]` items — can share
//! the same constants.
