//! Semantic roles, and the two renderings of a role-tagged value.
//!
//! A call site tags a value with what it *means* — either directly
//! ([`Role::Ok`] for a healthy-workspace line) or by naming the vocabulary it
//! came from ([`role_for`]) — and [`cell`] or [`text`] turns that into ANSI.
//! No call site names a color, and none asks whether color is permitted:
//! emission is gated once, by the sink, via
//! [`OutputSink::apply_color_policy`](crate::output::sink::OutputSink::apply_color_policy)
//! for the `colored` paths here and by `output::table` for the `comfy_table`
//! ones. See `docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/color-and-styling.md`
//! (ADR-0308).
