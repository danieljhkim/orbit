//! The one place the CLI writes a command's records to stdout.
//!
//! `main` resolves the sink, dispatches, and hands the returned
//! [`CommandOutput`] here. This module owns the projection from payload to
//! bytes for all four modes of
//! `docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/output-modes.md` §3 (ADR-0306,
//! step 3). No command body writes a record to stdout, so a rendering
//! decision cannot be made in 154 places any more — it is made here, once,
//! from the sink `main` already resolved.
//!
//! Everything that is not a record goes to stderr in every mode (spec §5):
//! empty-state lines, dropped-column notices, and progress.
