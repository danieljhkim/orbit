//! A closed stdout is a normal way for a command to end, not a failure.
//!
//! `orbit task list | head -1` closes the read end after one line. The next
//! `println!` fails with `EPIPE`, and `std::io::_print` responds by panicking —
//! so the user's terminal fills with a backtrace for having typed `head`.
//! `docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/output-modes.md` §5 says instead:
//! exit `0`, silently.
//!
//! Two paths reach that outcome, because the crate writes stdout two ways.
//! [`install_handler`] covers the `println!` family, whose failure mode is a
//! panic. [`is_broken_pipe`] covers the handful of call sites that hold a
//! locked writer and get an `io::Error` back instead.
