//! What a command hands back: a machine-readable document plus the human view
//! of the same records.
//!
//! A command body builds one of these and returns it. It does not choose a
//! format, does not ask whether stdout is a terminal, and does not write to
//! stdout — `output::render` projects the payload into the mode the sink
//! resolved, per `docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/output-modes.md` §3
//! (ADR-0306, step 3).
//!
//! The invariant the two halves owe each other (spec §3): the human view may
//! omit fields and reformat values, but it may not show a value the document
//! lacks, and it may not omit a record the document includes. Building both
//! from the same collected records in one place is what makes that checkable —
//! the previous shape, an `if self.json { … } else { … }` fork in every
//! command, is what let them drift.
