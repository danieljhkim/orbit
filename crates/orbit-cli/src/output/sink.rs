//! The output sink: one answer per invocation to "who is reading this?".
//!
//! Resolved once at startup from stdout, the process environment, and the
//! global `--format` argument, per `docs/design/terminal-interface/specs/output-modes.md`
//! §1–§2 ([ADR-0306]). Nothing downstream re-derives these answers: this module
//! is the only place in the crate that queries terminal state, a property
//! enforced by `scripts/check-terminal-state-guard.sh`.
//!
//! `main` resolves the sink, calls [`OutputSink::apply_color_policy`], and
//! hands the sink to `output::render`, which is the only consumer. Commands
//! return payloads and never see a sink at all, so there is no process global
//! to read: the value is a parameter of the single render call [ORB-10586,
//! superseding ADR-0314's process-global decision]. Color emission is decided
//! in exactly one place: `apply_color_policy` overrides the `colored` crate's
//! own env detection, and `output::table` is handed the same answer for
//! `comfy_table`, so the two styling backends can no longer disagree about
//! `NO_COLOR` [ADR-0308].
