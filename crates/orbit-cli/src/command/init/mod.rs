//! Configuration itself is owned by `orbit-config`, which is deliberately
//! host-blind: it neither probes `PATH` nor touches a terminal. The two pieces

//! [`agent_detect`] discovers which provider CLIs are installed, and
//! [`agent_prompt`] collects crew choices from stdin — and their results are
//! handed down as an explicit `orbit_config::ConfigSeed`.
