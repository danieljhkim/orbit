//! `orbit mcp callers` — read and seed this machine's caller authorization.
//!
//! The file is an operator artifact, so these subcommands are deliberately
//! read-mostly: `list` and `check` answer "what would this destination serve",
//! `init` transcribes machine IDs the operator already has, and `authorize`
//! renders a line for a file it does not own. Granting `operator` stays a hand
//! edit [ORB-11052], and installing an `authorized_keys` line stays an
//! operator action [ORB-11053].
