//! `orbit task start` — hidden compatibility shim.
//!
//! Approval and the move to `in-progress` both live on `orbit task update`
//! now (`--approve`, `--status in-progress`), so this verb is off the help
//! surface. It still runs, unchanged, because scripts and agent prompts that
//! predate the move are still calling it; it warns on stderr and will be
//! removed after a couple of releases.
//!
//! Nothing else in the tree should reach for it. The `orbit.task.start` tool
//! remains the pipeline's own entrypoint and is not affected.
