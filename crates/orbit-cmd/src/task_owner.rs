//! Which registered workspace owns a globally unique task ID.
//!
//! Task IDs are a machine-global primary key in the coordination task registry,
//! so `task show` follows the ID instead of the caller's cwd or MCP session
//! [ORB-10797]. This module is the single owner of that lookup and of the
//! registry identity (`orbit (ws_orbit)`) the command reports; the CLI
//! subcommand and the authoritative MCP server both call it rather than
//! repeating the join.
//!
//! Scope is deliberately `task show`. Every other verb keeps cwd or the
//! announced session workspace as its default, because only a read addressed
//! by a globally unique ID can be routed from the ID alone.
