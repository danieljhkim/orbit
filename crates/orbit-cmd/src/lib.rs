// ORB-10016: command modules moved from orbit-core keep their documentation
// posture; the legacy surfaces still need a focused documentation pass.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
// Unit tests use unwrap/expect for fixture setup; production call sites remain linted.
#![cfg_attr(test, allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::unwrap_used))]
//! Command-layer surfaces extracted from `orbit-core` [ORB-10016].
//!
//! Each module owns one CLI-facing command group whose implementation is a
//! pure consumer of the [`orbit_core::OrbitRuntime`] public API. Runtime
//! methods that used to be inherent `impl OrbitRuntime` blocks are exposed as
//! per-module extension traits (`*Commands`); import the trait (or
//! `orbit_cmd::prelude::*`) to call them.
//!
//! # Role
//! Depends on `orbit-core` (runtime/context) and composes it with
//! `orbit-registry` where an application needs both — never the other way
//! around. Consumed by `orbit-cli` and `orbit-web`.
//! Command groups that
//! orbit-core's runtime internals (tool hosts, engine hosts, bootstrap
//! seeding) invoke remain in `orbit-core::command`; see `ARCHITECTURE.md`
//! for the boundary.
