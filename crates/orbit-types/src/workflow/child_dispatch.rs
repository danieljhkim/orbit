//! Durable record of a child job run dispatched by a parent run's step.
//!
//! A parent that submits a child Run and then blocks on it has two distinct
//! lifecycle phases — submission and waiting — that used to be invisible from
//! the outside: the deterministic action kept the child's `run_id` in a local
//! variable and the engine did not persist the activity output until the wait
//! returned. A parent could therefore sit on a dispatch step for the whole
//! wait timeout with no durable child identifier, and an operator could not
//! tell a healthy long wait apart from a dispatch wedged before persistence.
//!
//! [`ChildDispatch`] is that missing checkpoint. It is written into the
//! parent's `PipelineState` immediately after `orbit.pipeline.invoke` returns
//! a durable child run id and before the parent blocks, so CLI, MCP, API, and
//! dashboard readers all resolve the same lineage from one persisted record.
