//! Structural classification of the activities a [`JobV2`] can dispatch.
//!
//! A job declares two structurally distinct kinds of activity:
//!
//! * **step activities** — the work the job exists to do;
//! * **recovery activities** — named by `recovery_activity` at the job level
//!   or on an individual step, dispatched only after that step fails.
//!
//! # Matching what the store actually records
//!
//! The identifier an `invocations` row carries in `activity_id` is *not*
//! uniformly the catalog activity name. The job executor persists a dispatched
//! step's trace under the **step id**, while a recovery dispatch — which has
//! no step of its own — is persisted under the **recovery activity name**.
//! [`JobActivityRoles::step`] therefore holds both identifiers a step
//! invocation can be recorded under: the step's `id`, and the catalog name
//! from its `target` (an inlined [`TargetStep`]'s `activity_name`, or an
//! unresolved [`TargetRef`] of the form `activity:<name>`). Collecting only
//! one of the two would leave real step work unattributed and silently deflate
//! any denominator built from this set.
//!
//! Reliability reporting needs the recovery set to be *discovered* rather than
//! enumerated in source: which activity performs recovery is a property of the
//! workspace's job definitions, not of Orbit. [`JobV2::activity_roles`] walks
//! the declared job structure and returns both sets, so a caller can attribute
//! observed invocations without ever hardcoding an activity id [ORB-10588].
//!
//! An activity may legitimately appear in both sets (a job can name the same
//! activity as a step target and as another step's recovery hook). Callers
//! that need disjoint sets should treat `recovery` as taking precedence, since
//! an invocation of a dual-role activity cannot be attributed structurally.
