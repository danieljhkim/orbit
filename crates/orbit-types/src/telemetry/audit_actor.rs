//! Canonical actor identity for audit events (ORB-10888).
//!
//! The `audit_events.role` column is a single free-text label that conflates
//! five unrelated kinds of value: agent families (`claude`), model strings
//! (`claude-opus-5`, `opus`), system/synthetic markers (`admin`, `hook`),
//! unattributed markers (`unknown`, `unverified`, `agent`), and humans
//! (`human`). Every per-agent aggregate built on it is therefore unsound: the
//! same actor is split across three granularities, and synthetic buckets
//! outrank real agents.
//!
//! This module is the one place that turns a recorded label into a canonical
//! [`CanonicalActor`]: an [`ActorKind`] plus, for agents, separately
//! addressable vendor / family / model fields. Persistence materializes the
//! result into columns so aggregate SQL can `GROUP BY` the canonical actor;
//! adding a new model means editing [`canonical_actor_for_role_label`], never
//! an aggregate query.
//!
//! ## Trust is not identity
//!
//! This module normalizes identity *shape* only. It never rewrites `role`, and
//! `unverified` maps to its own unattributed actor rather than being resolved
//! to whatever agent the label hints at. Trust classification reads `role` and
//! is unaffected by anything here.
//!
//! ## Alias-map versioning
//!
//! [`ACTOR_ALIAS_MAP_VERSION`] stamps every derived record. Re-running an
//! aggregate over old rows is stable because the rows carry the version that
//! produced them: a map change is a version bump plus a re-derivation step,
//! not a silent reinterpretation. See `docs/design/audit-actor-identity/`.
