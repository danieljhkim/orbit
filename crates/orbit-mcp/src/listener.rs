//! TCP listener transport for the MCP kernel.
//!
//! The protocol handler performs no IO of its own, so serving it over a socket
//! is only a question of where the byte stream comes from, who owns the session
//! behind it, and which addresses may be bound. Framing, dispatch, and the
//! trusted session envelope are shared verbatim with stdio: this module adds no
//! capability, placement, routing, or authorization step of its own.
