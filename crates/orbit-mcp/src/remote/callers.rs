//! The destination's statement about who may call it, and as what [ORB-11052].
//!
//! [`CALLERS_FILE`] is the mirror of the federated destinations file:
//! destinations declare who this machine may call, callers declare who may
//! call this machine and with which capabilities. Both are machine-global
//! operator files; neither belongs in a workspace.
//!
//! # Why a destination-side file at all
//!
//! On an SSH destination the caller writes the remote argv, so `--operator` on
//! `orbit mcp serve` was a caller-authored grant: anyone with shell access
//! stamped their own session `Operator` and satisfied every governed
//! operation. This module moves the *statement* to the machine that executes
//! the work — the caller's argv becomes a request, and the file is the
//! ceiling.
//!
//! # How strong the identity is depends on the destination
//!
//! Two tiers share this file, and a reader must never assume which one
//! answered. Under Tier 1 the caller identity is self-asserted:
//! `--remote-caller-machine-id` is a label the caller chooses, so a caller that
//! can reach this destination can also name a different row. That is an
//! accident guard, in keeping with the governance kernel's doctrine — strictly
//! stronger than a caller-authored grant, and not a boundary anything may be
//! relaxed against.
//!
//! Under Tier 2 [ORB-11053] the destination pins the identity to a key in its
//! own `authorized_keys`, sshd authenticates that key, and the forced command
//! Orbit runs names the caller. There the identity is a real boundary for the
//! remote case. [`RemoteCallerIdentity`] carries which of the two applies all
//! the way into the audit row, so the difference is recorded rather than
//! assumed. See [`super::ssh_auth`].
