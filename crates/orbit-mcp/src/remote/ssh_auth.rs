//! What sshd told this destination about the session it started [ORB-11053].
//!
//! Tier 1 of destination-side caller authorization keys on a label the caller
//! chose, so it can only be an accident guard. This module supplies the
//! missing half: the caller identity is written by the *destination*, next to
//! a public key, in a root-managed `AuthorizedKeysFile`, and sshd will not run
//! that forced command for anyone who cannot complete the key exchange. A
//! destination-issued bearer capability arrives through an sshd-set key
//! environment rather than argv. The CLI makes that environment unreadable
//! before it parses any arguments; Orbit persists only the capability digest.
//!
//! Three things live here, and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. The `SHA256:` fingerprint of an SSH public key, in the form `ssh-keygen`
//!    and `sshd` print, so an operator can compare what Orbit says with what
//!    their own tools say without a conversion step.
//! 2. Destination-issued acceptance capabilities and optional observation of
//!    the key that authenticated a Tier 1 session.
//! 3. The `authorized_keys` line an operator installs. Orbit renders it and
//!    never writes it: that file governs shell access to the whole machine,
//!    which is far more than Orbit's business.
