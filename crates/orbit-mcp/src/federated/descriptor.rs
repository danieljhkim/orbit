//! The federated workspace descriptor — the pinned wire shape of the mux list.
//!
//! A descriptor is a v1 workspace record as one destination reported it, plus
//! exactly six federated keys: `selector`, `host`, `machine_id`,
//! `reachability`, `checkout_health`, and `capabilities`. Those names are
//! protocol, so reachability and checkout presence stay two separate fields
//! rather than one merged `health`, and `machine_id` sits on every descriptor
//! instead of on the envelope the way v1 keys it.
