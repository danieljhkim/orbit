//! The federated MCP namespace: a mux over the accepting machine plus
//! operator-configured SSH remotes.
//!
//! This module is the one place in Orbit where an MCP server also acts as an
//! MCP *client*. It exists so a caller can see the accepting machine's
//! workspaces and every configured remote destination's workspaces as one
//! session-unbound list of live descriptors, each carrying the host-qualified
//! selector a later routed call will address. Local selectors are delivered
//! in-process; remotes reuse the v1 SSH argv. v1's byte-transparent SSH proxy
//! ([`crate::serve_mcp_remote_proxy`]) is unchanged and remains the path for a
//! caller that has already chosen one host.
//!
//! The mux is deliberately not a fleet registry: remote membership comes only
//! from the operator's [`DESTINATIONS_FILE`]. The accepting machine is an
//! implicit local destination and is not declared as an SSH row. No
//! destination's answer is cached between calls.
