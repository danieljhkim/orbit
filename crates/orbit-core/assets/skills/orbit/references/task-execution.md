# Executing a task

Carry a task from intent to verified implementation with explicit lifecycle
tracking. Every `orbit.task.*` call needs `model` — your agent family.

No task ID yet? Clarify intent with the human, then use
[task-authoring.md](task-authoring.md). Reviewing someone else's work instead?
[task-review.md](task-review.md).

## Step 1 — Load

`orbit.task.show`, then extract `description` and `acceptance_criteria` (the
required outcome), `plan` (author one if blank or placeholder), `context_files`,
and `status`.

Read each `file:` target with the provider-native file-read tool. For a `dir:`
selector, do not call the file-read tool on the directory: after verifying it
resolves beneath the workspace root, use `rg --files <directory>` to list it,
then read its key files individually.

Then surface prior related decisions the author never linked:

```bash
orbit tool run orbit.search --input '{"semantic":"<task-id>","limit":5,"model":"<agent-family>"}'
```

Non-blocking — skip it if nothing is relevant, or if the task has no vectors yet.

## Step 2 — Plan

`orbit.task.update` with a concrete markdown `plan` — target files, validation
commands, risks — if one doesn't exist.

## Step 3 — Start

`orbit.task.start` with a `note`. Moves `backlog`/`proposed` → `in-progress` and
records approval. Starting from `proposed` still requires a real plan.

## Step 4 — Implement and validate

Follow the plan, inspecting files with the provider-native file-read tool.
Verify transitive impact with `rg` or by reading callers directly. Run the
repo-approved verification commands, honoring repo instructions if tests are
forbidden.

**Keep `context_files` current.** If implementation surfaces a file outside the
original list, append its canonical selector via `orbit.task.update` as soon as
you discover it — don't wait until handoff. Conflict detection reads live from
in-flight tasks, not only from reservation records, so an up-to-date list is how
a worker excludes others from files it owns. Reservation itself is the system's
job: there is no worker-callable lock tool, and none should be reached for. One
caveat — an added entry binds only reservations requested *after* the update; it
cannot retroactively revoke one a concurrent run already holds.

**In a linked pipeline worktree, never use positional `git stash` /
`git stash pop`.** Refs and the stash list are repository-global, so a positional
pop can restore another session's work. Record the worktree's initial
`git rev-parse HEAD` and compare against that explicit baseline with
`git diff <baseline-sha> -- <paths>`.

## Step 5 — Summarize and hand off

Persist `execution_summary` via `orbit.task.update` **first**.

Then consider friction: if the task surfaced a contradicted assumption, a
recurring failure mode, a non-obvious gotcha, or an incident root cause, record
it — see [friction.md](friction.md). Then:

- **Under an activity envelope** (e.g. `agent_implement`): persist the summary
  only. The pipeline owns the `review` transition after commit/merge/PR steps
  succeed.
- **Direct execution** (no envelope): persist the summary *and* move to `review`
  via `orbit.task.update`.

The generated PR body already supplies `## Task` / `## Execution Summary` /
`## Validation` / `## Branch Freshness`, so don't duplicate those headings.
Required content:

```markdown
Outcome: success | failed
Changes:
- <what changed and why>
Assessment: <short quality assessment>
```

Include when relevant: `Strategic decisions:`, `Design weaknesses / risks:`
(with Severity/Mitigation), `Deviations from original plan:` (with
Justification), `Recommended follow-ups:`.

## Lifecycle rules

One task per activity invocation — no multiplexing. Ask clarifying questions
before implementing if material ambiguity remains. If approval for `proposed`
work can't be obtained, stop after recording that state. Direct execution must
persist a non-empty `execution_summary` before or with the review transition.

Exit: task started via `orbit.task.start`; execution summary persisted; friction
checkpoint considered; direct execution advanced to `review`.
