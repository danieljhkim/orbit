# Setting Orbit up

Get from nothing to a workspace where tasks, search, and dispatch all work. Use
this when `.orbit/` is absent, when the user is still deciding whether to adopt
Orbit, or when a second machine or repository needs onboarding.

This reference works without an Orbit source checkout. For release-specific
installation details, consult the [published README](https://github.com/danieljhkim/orbit#quick-start)
and compare the version with `orbit --version`. Do not assume a newer website
or a locally modified resource catalog matches the installed binary.

## Step 1 — Detect current state

Run in parallel; the answers pick the branch:

```bash
command -v orbit          # is the binary on PATH?
test -d .orbit            # is this workspace initialized?
test -d ~/.orbit          # is this machine initialized?
```

Report all three before proposing any install.

## Step 2 — Install

A prebuilt CLI gives you setup, dashboard, and administration commands:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieljhkim/orbit/main/install.sh | sh
# Alternative when Homebrew is the chosen package manager:
brew install danieljhkim/tap/orbit
```

Choose one installation method; do not run both. Agent plugins provide the MCP
integration and bundled skill through their own package distribution, and do
not require a source checkout. Source builds are optional for customization;
follow the published README for toolchain and build instructions if that is
what the user requested. Respect the user's install destination and existing
installation; ask only for missing choices or required host permissions.

Before dispatch, verify an authenticated supported agent CLI on the execution
host. PR mode also needs an authenticated `gh` client. On Linux, `/usr/bin/bwrap`
must pass its namespace/mount probe; Ubuntu's AppArmor restrictions may require
the packaged narrow Bubblewrap profile. Follow the
[Linux host runbook](https://github.com/danieljhkim/orbit/blob/main/docs/runbooks/linux-sandbox.md)
for privileged setup. Do not disable host protection or enable sandbox fallback
to hide a failed probe.

## Step 3 — Initialize the machine

```bash
orbit init
```

This creates `~/.orbit/` and, on a fresh machine, establishes host identity. Two
values are asked for and both matter:

**Host name** — how this machine is named in routine `hosts:` pins. Defaults to
the OS hostname. Renameable later with `orbit host rename`.

**Task prefix** — 2–5 uppercase ASCII letters that namespace every task ID this
machine allocates. **Chosen once and never changed.** Its whole purpose is to
keep two machines that share a repository from allocating the same ID, so on a
second machine pick a *different* prefix — see [multi-host.md](multi-host.md)
before initializing one.

Non-interactive runs must pass both explicitly:

```bash
orbit init --non-interactive --host-name <name> --task-prefix <PREFIX>
```

## Step 4 — Initialize the workspace

From the repository root:

```bash
orbit workspace init --base-branch <integration-branch> --ship-mode pr --mcp
```

This registers the checkout, creates `.orbit/`, and seeds the default skills,
jobs, activities, policies, routines, and auto-task definitions. `--mcp`
auto-detects installed agent clients and registers Orbit's MCP server with
them as `orbit mcp serve --operator --workspace <ws_id>` — **operator
authority**, so the registered integration can dispatch workflows
(`orbit.workflow.ship`), observe/resume runs, and run `orbit.command.exec`.
This is the deliberate bootstrap path for a human-facing orchestrator; bare
`orbit mcp serve` and any worker/agent-launched MCP session stay agent-only.
`--workspace` binds the session to the workspace being registered, so
workspace-scoped tools route without an explicit selector on every call —
most MCP clients cannot announce one at initialize.

Choose the real integration branch; do not assume the product default `main`
is the repository's landing branch. `--ship-mode local` selects worktree-based
local merge delivery instead of opening PRs. For another host's workspace, use
`--role replica --owner <owner-machine-id>` rather than creating another owner.
See [multi-host.md](multi-host.md).

Two things to know about what it seeded:

- **Every routine and auto-task ships disabled.** The automation layer is
  installed but dark until someone reviews and opts in. Do not assume a fresh
  workspace schedules anything. → [automation.md](automation.md)
- **Definitions belong in git; state does not.** `orbit workspace init` seeds a
  `.gitignore` pattern that ignores `.orbit/` and then re-includes the versioned
  definition directories. Keep it.

Ordinary `orbit mcp init` installs agent-only authority, unlike the operator
bootstrap above. Re-registering a client is not a way to preserve or grant
operator authority implicitly. For federated setup use `mcp init --federated`
and [remote-access.md](remote-access.md).

Targeting specific clients, or a second pass later:

```bash
orbit mcp init --client claude --client codex        # repeatable
orbit mcp init --all --scope home                    # user-level rather than repo-local
```

Supported clients: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `grok`, `cursor`, `vscode`,
`windsurf`. `--scope workspace` (the default) writes repo-local config;
`--scope home` writes user-level config.

## Step 5 — Verify

```bash
orbit --version
orbit workspace show
orbit tool run orbit.task.list --input '{"model":"<agent-family>","workspace":"<workspace-id>"}'
orbit doctor
```

`orbit doctor` is the real check — it inspects config, database, disk, indexes,
locks, and runs. Report its output. If anything fails, fix it before handing
off; do not declare success on a passing `--version` alone.

Optional, and only with explicit operator consent — semantic search needs a
local companion downloaded:

```bash
orbit semantic install
orbit semantic stats
```

Lexical search works without it. → [search.md](../search.md)

## Step 6 — Hand off

- **First real task** — route through [task-authoring.md](../task-authoring.md).
  Do not silently author it; the quality gates are worth the user seeing.
- **Feature tour** — read the README's feature section and summarize against the
  user's stated goal, not generically.

## What to set up next

In rough order of payoff, once the first task has landed:

1. **A docs corpus** — register the markdown the repo already has, so agents
   retrieve by concept instead of filename. → [docs-corpus.md](../docs-corpus.md)
2. **Crews and base branch** — point `workflow.base_branch` at the branch task
   PRs should target, and set a default crew. → [configuration.md](configuration.md)
3. **The scheduler** — host clock, then routines, in the documented order.
   → [automation.md](automation.md)
4. **Recurring chores** — QA sweeps, friction curation, anything periodic.
   → [auto-tasks.md](auto-tasks.md)
5. **Task publication** — bind a dedicated snapshot repository and verify one
   publish/inspect cycle before relying on recovery. → [publication.md](publication.md)
6. **Upgrade convergence** — use `orbit workspace sync --check`, then
   `orbit workspace sync` to refresh managed defaults. → [maintenance.md](maintenance.md)

## Anti-patterns

- Check the installed release and effective resource catalog when commands
  differ from these examples; do not rebuild Orbit just to access a task.
- Don't pick a task prefix casually on a second machine. It cannot be changed.
- Don't enable every seeded routine at once. Enable worktree GC before, not
  after, scheduling ship traffic.
- Don't run `orbit semantic install` without consent — it downloads a model.
