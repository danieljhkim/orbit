//! [ORB-10597] A terminal outcome that contradicts the one already persisted
//! must be recorded, not silently dropped.
//!
//! Reproduces the shape of `jrun-20260802-2013-2`: a run marked `interrupted`
//! while it was still working, which then ran to a genuine success. Before this
//! change the success was discarded with no error, no warning, and nothing in
//! the durable record, leaving the run record permanently contradicting its own
//! steps and audit trail.
