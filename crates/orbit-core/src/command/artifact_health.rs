//! Standing health of the *definition artifacts* a workspace accumulates —
//! skills, jobs, activities, auto-tasks, and routines [ORB-10800].
//!
//! `orbit doctor` already diagnoses infrastructure (config, database, disk,
//! indexes, locks, runs). This module supplies the missing half: the
//! definitions themselves, classified into three conditions.
//!
//! - **Faulty** — the file fails to parse or validate, so its definition is
//!   absent at dispatch time even though the file is still on disk.
//! - **Deprecated** — the managed manifest proves Orbit wrote this file for a
//!   default that the running binary no longer ships.
//! - **Stale** — the file is a managed copy of an *older* release of a default
//!   this binary still ships, or an untracked file colliding with a bundled
//!   default name.
//!
//! Every judgement is made from the per-kind managed manifest written by
//! [`super::reconcile_managed_assets`] (ADR-0346, extended to all five kinds by
//! ADR-0366), never from filename guessing. That matters for correctness as
//! well as safety: precedence differs across kinds — skills merge
//! workspace-over-global while activities keep shipped defaults authoritative
//! over workspace copies — so a rule phrased in terms of "which copy wins"
//! would misreport at least one kind. Provenance is a property of the file
//! Orbit wrote, in the directory Orbit wrote it to, and is unaffected by which
//! copy a loader later prefers.
//!
//! Repair ([`OrbitRuntime::remove_stale_definition_artifacts`]) is deliberately
//! narrower than diagnosis: only a *deprecated* artifact whose digest still
//! proves Orbit wrote it is removed. A locally modified one is preserved
//! outside the active catalog exactly as init-time reconciliation does, and a
//! faulty user-authored file is never touched.
