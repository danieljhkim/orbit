//! Pipeline-reliability aggregation over durable run state [ORB-10588].
//!
//! Answers two operator questions that were previously only reachable by
//! opening SQLite by hand: how often job runs fail, and how often the recovery
//! path fires.
//!
//! # Inputs
//!
//! Everything here derives from persisted `job_runs` and `invocations` rows.
//! No agent-loop output, no token field, and no cost field is read — see
//! [`orbit_store::contracts::JobRunOutcomeFact`] and
//! [`orbit_store::contracts::ActivityInvocationCount`] for the projected column sets.
//!
//! # Outcome classification
//!
//! `job_runs.state` is not two-valued, so a "failure rate" has to say which
//! states it counts. [`RunOutcome`] partitions the [`JobRunState`] variants:
//!
//! | outcome | states | in failure-rate denominator |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`RunOutcome::Succeeded`] | `success` | yes |
//! | [`RunOutcome::Failed`] | `failed`, `timeout`, `interrupted` | yes |
//! | [`RunOutcome::Cancelled`] | `cancelled` | no |
//! | [`RunOutcome::Skipped`] | `skipped` | no |
//! | [`RunOutcome::InFlight`] | `pending`, `running`, `retrying` | no |
//! | [`RunOutcome::Unknown`] | any state this build cannot parse | no |
//!
//! `timeout` and `interrupted` count as failures: both are runs the pipeline
//! intended to finish and did not. `interrupted` specifically means the owning
//! process died without finalizing, which is a reliability event even though
//! the run's checkpoints can seed a resumed follow-up. `cancelled` is a
//! deliberate operator action, so counting it as a failure would make manual
//! intervention look like breakage. `skipped` never ran.
//!
//! Because four of the six outcomes sit outside the denominator,
//! `succeeded + failed` does **not** equal the run count in general. Callers
//! render [`OutcomeCounts::settled`] as the `n` and report the excluded
//! buckets separately; [`OutcomeCounts::total`] is kept so the gap is visible
//! rather than implied away.
//!
//! # Recovery attribution
//!
//! Which activity performs recovery is a property of a workspace's job
//! definitions, never of Orbit, so the recovery activity set is discovered by
//! walking the job catalog ([`JobV2::activity_roles`]) at query time. An
//! activity that a catalog uses in both roles is reported as ambiguous and
//! excluded from the numerator, since its invocations cannot be attributed
//! structurally.
