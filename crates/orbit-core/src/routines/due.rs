//! Due computation for routines [ORB-10021]: given a cron trigger, the
//! host-local cursor, and "now", decide whether a routine fires this sweep
//! and for which scheduled slot.
//!
//! The computation is O(1) per routine — `find_previous_occurrence` from
//! `now`, compared against the cursor — never an iteration over every slot
//! in a gap, so a week of downtime against a minutely cron costs the same
//! as one minute.
