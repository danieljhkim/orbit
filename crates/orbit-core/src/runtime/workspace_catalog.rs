//! Registry-neutral seam for reads that span more than one workspace.
//!
//! Core owns no workspace catalog: `orbit-registry` sits above it in the crate
//! graph. A federated read therefore needs a higher composition layer to answer
//! two questions — *which checkouts does this scope cover* and *open a runtime
//! for one of them* — while Core keeps ownership of fan-out, fusion,
//! attribution, and degradation notes [ORB-11027].
//!
//! The seam mirrors [`super::OrbitRuntime::with_coordination_write_owner`]: a
//! standalone runtime constructed without a catalog still works, and simply
//! refuses any scope wider than its own workspace.
