//! Coupling-out on run terminalization: when a job run reaches a terminal
//! *failure* state (`failed`, `timeout`, `cancelled`), every task coupled to
//! that run — stamped with its `job_run_id` during `worktree_setup` — is moved
//! to `blocked` so a human/orchestrator has to look before anything runs again.
//!
//! This is the symmetric counterpart to the coupling-in that
//! `worktree_setup` performs (stamping `job_run_id` and moving tasks to
//! `in_progress`). It reuses the same `blocked_workflow_failure_update` helper
//! the legacy parallel-batch path already uses, so the status event
//! (`workflow_run_failed`) and note format stay consistent across paths.
//!
//! `blocked` is a deliberate dead end for automation: `Blocked` is not in the
//! workflow-admission allowlist, so the ship
//! sweep skips these tasks. The only way out is a human/orchestrator decision
//! (`orbit task start`, which accepts `Blocked`, or moving it back to backlog).
