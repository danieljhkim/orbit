//! [ORB-10470] Resume planning: retry-lineage ownership + checkpoint reuse.
//!
//! A resumed run is not a fresh submission. It re-enters a workflow that a
//! previous attempt already admitted, in a worktree that attempt created,
//! against tasks that attempt stamped with its own `job_run_id`. Two durable
//! facts therefore have to be reconciled *before* the resumed run reaches its
//! delivery tail (F2026-07-121 / F2026-07-122):
//!
//! 1. **Blocked tasks.** A terminal run failure blocks every coupled task
//!    (`runtime::task::block_on_run_failure`), and `blocked` is not in the
//!    workflow-admission allowlist. If the resumed run replays
//!    `worktree_setup`, admission rejects the very task the resume exists to
//!    recover — a catch-22.
//! 2. **Ownership drift.** When checkpoints *are* reused, `worktree_setup` is
//!    skipped, so nothing re-claims the task. Downstream delivery steps keep
//!    consuming the checkpointed `steps.<worktree>.output.job_run_id` as their
//!    batch id, while the task record may have been re-stamped by an
//!    intervening failed attempt. `load_handoff_context` then fails closed with
//!    "task ... no longer belongs to job run ...".
//!
//! Both are repaired by reconciling against the run's **explicit retry
//! lineage** — the source run, its `retry_source_run_id` ancestors, and the
//! runs descended from them — and never against an unrelated run. A task
//! stamped by a run outside that lineage is left exactly as it is, so the
//! ownership check in `load_handoff_context` keeps its full strength.
