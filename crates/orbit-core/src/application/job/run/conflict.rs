//! [ORB-10597] Terminal-outcome conflict recording.
//!
//! A run's terminal state is written once and never overwritten: `finalize_run`
//! returns early when the run is already terminal. That guard is correct — see
//! below — but on its own it made a *conflicting* second outcome indistinguishable
//! from an idempotent replay, so a run condemned to `interrupted` while it was
//! still working could run to a genuine success and have that success dropped
//! with no error, no warning, and nothing in the durable record. The run's
//! state, `finished_at`, and `duration_ms` then permanently contradicted its own
//! steps and audit trail.
//!
//! ## Why first-writer-wins on `state` is kept
//!
//! Letting the later outcome overwrite was rejected:
//!
//! - **The first terminalization already fired irreversible side effects.**
//!   Coupled tasks were blocked, task reservations and file locks released, the
//!   routine fire resolved. Flipping the run to `success` afterwards asserts a
//!   consistency that no longer holds, and nothing re-acquires what was released.
//! - **Cancellation must not be revocable.** `orbit job cancel` writes
//!   `Cancelled`; a worker that reports success moments later must not resurrect
//!   the run, or cancel becomes racy by construction.
//! - **Replay determinism.** Finalization is reachable from several paths
//!   (`exec`, the pipeline worker, reconcile, cancel). Last-writer-wins makes the
//!   persisted state depend on their interleaving.
//!
//! What was actually missing is not a winner rule but a *record*: the operator
//! needs to know the two outcomes disagreed. So the terminal state stands and
//! the conflicting outcome is recorded durably and loudly instead of dropped.
//!
//! ## Where a reader sees it
//!
//! 1. A diagnostic step appended to the run, stamped `error_code =
//!    terminal_outcome_conflict`, naming both outcomes and the reported finish
//!    time. Visible wherever run steps are — `orbit run show <run_id>` and the
//!    dashboard run detail — right next to the state it contradicts.
//! 2. An audit row under the `pipeline.run.terminal_conflict` tool name,
//!    targeted at the run, carrying both states as structured arguments.
//! 3. A `tracing::warn!` on `orbit.core.job_run` for log-based alerting.
