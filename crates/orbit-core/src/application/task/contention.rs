//! Lock contention across a pending task population.
//!
//! Throughput under conflict-aware dispatch is bounded by how much of the
//! backlog can hold non-overlapping locks at once. Whether the backlog is
//! draining is a separate question from why it drains at the rate it does;
//! this answers the second by naming the selectors pending tasks keep
//! colliding on, and by measuring how far the population decomposes into
//! clusters that can never block one another.
//!
//! Surfaces come from the same expansion conflict admission uses — declared
//! selectors, pruned of paths that no longer exist, unioned across descendants
//! for an epic root. A contention picture admission does not share is not
//! worth reading.
