//! Multi-workspace dashboard state (ORB-00030).
//!
//! The dashboard was originally coupled to a single `Arc<OrbitRuntime>` used
//! directly as axum state. To let one server serve every registered workspace
//! on the machine, state is generalized to a workspace-keyed, lazily-built
//! runtime map ([`DashboardState`]) and handlers receive their runtime through
//! the [`Ws`] extractor (which selects a workspace from the `?workspace=<id>`
//! query parameter, falling back to the configured default).
//!
//! [`DashboardState::single`] preserves the original single-workspace behavior:
//! one pre-built runtime, always selected, no lazy construction. `orbit web
//! serve` no longer reaches it (it always serves in global mode as of
//! ORB-10029); it is retained for [`crate::serve`] (callers embedding an
//! already-built `OrbitRuntime`) and for every existing handler test, which
//! builds an in-memory runtime and wants a trivial single-workspace harness.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model (ORB-10294)
//!
//! The registered workspace set is an immutable [`Snapshot`] stamped with a
//! monotonic **generation**, swapped atomically on [`DashboardState::refresh`].
//! The runtime cache is a *non-authoritative* memo: every read and every
//! publication is validated against an exact binding (runtime workspace id +
//! repo root + ship mode + `orbit_dir`) taken from a **pinned** snapshot
//! generation, so a runtime built
//! for an older snapshot can never be returned as current nor overwrite a newer
//! binding. Each request boundary pins one snapshot ([`DashboardState::pin`] →
//! [`Pinned`]) and derives default selection, entry metadata, runtime
//! resolution, and the open-runtime set from that single generation, so a
//! concurrent add/remove/rebind is observed as one coherent old-or-new view —
//! never old metadata spliced onto a newer runtime.
