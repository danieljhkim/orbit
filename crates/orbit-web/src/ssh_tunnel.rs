//! Client-side SSH local-forward tunnel for `orbit web connect`.
//!
//! The web server is loopback-bound and has no authentication of its own.
//! Remote dashboard access therefore delegates authentication, encryption,
//! and host verification to SSH while keeping the HTTP listener private.
//!
//! Establishing is attach-first: a bare `-N` forward that
//! invokes nothing remotely is opened and probed, and only when nothing answers
//! behind it is a second `ssh` run that both forwards the port and starts the
//! remote command. Teardown therefore only ever stops what this process
//! started — an attached, pre-existing remote server is never touched.
//!
//! Deliberately synchronous: the tunnel is a child-process lifetime, not a
//! future. The `connect` command owns the small async wait around it.
