# Activity / Job — Design

This document describes the shipped Activity / Job substrate across `orbit-common`, `orbit-engine`, `orbit-core`, and `orbit-cli`: asset shape, normalization, dispatch boundaries, backend semantics, DAG execution, audit, and retained legacy edges. See [1_overview.md](./1_overview.md) for purpose and [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) for open questions.

---

## 1. Asset Shape and Two-Pass Loading

Activity / Job assets are `schemaVersion: 2` YAML envelopes with:

- `kind: Activity` or `kind: Job`
- `metadata.name`
- typed `spec`

The loader in `crates/orbit-common/src/types/activity_job/asset_loader.rs` reads the schema header first, then parses the full envelope into `ActivityV2` or `JobV2`; that shape arrived in [T20260418-2010]. `schemaVersion: 1` is retired after [T20260419-2156], and `kind` mismatches are structural errors, so an activity cannot dispatch as a job or vice versa.

---

## 2. Activity Surface

`ActivityV2` carries shared fields:

- `description`
- `input_schema_json`
- `output_schema_json`
- optional `fsProfile`

and then flattens one `ActivityV2Spec` variant:

- `AgentLoop(AgentLoopSpec)`
- `Deterministic(DeterministicSpec)`

The common `agent_loop` fields are:

- `instruction`
- `tools`
- `on_denial`
- optional `model`
- `max_iterations`
- `backend`
- `provider`
- `wall_clock_timeout_seconds`
- `require_response_envelope` (default `false`; opt in only when downstream
  templates consume structured response fields)
- `require_completion_envelope` (default `true`; opt **out** only for an
  activity whose non-completion is harmless — see §7.6a)

A former `Groundhog(GroundhogSpec)` variant (a sibling activity kind from [T20260420-0510-2]) was removed as unused in [ORB-10332]; activity specs are now only `agent_loop` and `deterministic`.

`DeterministicSpec` is just `{ action, config }`. A fourth variant, `Shell(ShellSpec)`, was removed in [ORB-00374] as a fail-closed security fix (see [ADR-0194](./4_decisions.md)); `type: shell` now fails to deserialize at load rather than spawning an unsandboxed subprocess.

---

## 3. Job Surface

`JobV2` carries:

- `state`
- optional `default_input`
- `max_active_runs`
- `kind`
- `steps`

`JobKind` is currently `workflow` or `subroutine`, added in [T20260419-0339]. The more interesting surface is the step grammar from [T20260418-2018]:

- every step has `id`
- every step may add `when`
- every step may add `retry`
- every step chooses exactly one body

The body is one of:

- flat `TargetStep`
- named `TargetRef`
- `parallel`
- `fan_out` plus matching `fan_in`
- `loop`

`TargetStep` is the executor-facing form. It inlines an `ActivityV2Spec` plus optional `fsProfile`, `default_input`, `timeout_seconds`, and optional `session`. `TargetRef` is the authoring-facing form: `target: activity:<name>`. It is resolved away before execution.

Step-local input layering landed earlier, but the shipped job-level `default_input` behavior changed in [T20260423-0445]:

- if the caller passes `null`, the run input becomes `job.default_input`
- if both the caller input and `job.default_input` are JSON objects, Orbit performs a shallow merge and caller-supplied keys win on conflict
- if the caller input is any non-object JSON value, it replaces `job.default_input` entirely

Step-level `default_input` is still recursively template-rendered before dispatch. Support landed in [T20260413-0141], entered the v2 DAG path in [T20260418-2018], and was corrected for job-level merges in [T20260423-0445].

---

## 4. Load-Time Normalization Pipeline

orbit-core normalizes raw YAML before dispatch.

Job catalog listing uses `MergeByKey` precedence after [T20260425-0204]: `ORBIT_JOB_DIR` / `ORBIT_V2_JOB_DIR` entries first, then workspace jobs, then global seeded jobs. The first valid `metadata.name` wins, so listing can show a workspace `task_auto_pipeline` in place of the global default without making the catalog ambiguous. Duplicate names inside one directory tree remain invalid because that single layer would otherwise be ambiguous.

Job execution deliberately has a different order: explicit `ORBIT_JOB_DIR` / `ORBIT_V2_JOB_DIR` entries, then global seeded jobs, then workspace jobs only for names that are not shipped defaults. Thus an explicit environment catalog can opt in to a replacement for testing or smoke runs, but a workspace-local file cannot shadow a shipped job when Orbit resolves that job by name for execution.

Activity resolution is likewise execution-oriented, but its directory order is explicit `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_DIR` / `ORBIT_V2_CATALOG_DIR`, then global seeded activities, then workspace activities. Explicit and global directories use first-wins loading. Workspace activities may add names that are absent from the catalog, but any workspace name matching a shipped default is skipped even if the global file is missing; a workspace activity also cannot replace an earlier explicit or global entry. Duplicate names inside one activity directory tree remain invalid.

This is an intentional default-shadowing asymmetry: job *listing* is workspace-preferred, while named job execution and activity resolution keep shipped defaults authoritative over workspace resources. The split follows [L-0060] and its originating security fix [ORB-00356]: display/catalog override semantics must not make checked-in workspace YAML executable in place of a trusted shipped default. That learning is the rationale; the runtime and job catalog code are authoritative for the exact loading behavior.

### 4.1 Managed materialization and retirement

Global activity and job defaults materialized by `orbit init` are managed
resources, not merely additive examples. After [ORB-10684] / [ADR-0346], each
resource directory carries a hidden `.orbit-managed-assets.json` manifest. Its
entry for a bundled file is the SHA-256 digest of the content Orbit last wrote;
the manifest is therefore the ownership authority for later retirement, while
the YAML filename alone never authorizes deletion.

Refresh applies the same reconciliation to activities and jobs:

- a previously managed name absent from the current embedded list is deleted
  when its bytes still match the recorded digest;
- a locally modified retired managed file is moved to
  `resources/.retired-managed/{activities,jobs}/`, preserving its content while
  keeping recursively loaded catalogs from activating it;
- an installation without a manifest adopts only exact current bundled bytes
  as managed; other YAML remains in place and `orbit init` warns with the paths
  plus the manual remedy to move or delete a stale legacy file;
- the new manifest contains only current assets whose managed ownership is
  established, so repeating refresh is idempotent.

This means a manifest-aware upgrade cannot leave a retired managed activity
with removed tool grants—or a retired managed job with removed actions—in the
catalog. Legacy files whose history cannot be proven remain operator-owned:
Orbit will not guess from their names, and the warning is the recovery contract
for installations predating managed provenance.

Direct single-activity runtime helpers:

1. Read YAML from disk.
2. Parse via `load_activity_asset(...)`.
3. Resolve `backend: auto` to a concrete backend.
4. Build audit sinks and run id with `system` as the v2 envelope `agent_identity`.
5. Dispatch the concrete `ActivityV2Spec`.

Job runs:

1. Read YAML from disk.
2. Parse via `load_job_asset(...)`.
3. Build the activity catalog from seeded/workspace activity directories.
4. Resolve every `target: activity:<name>` into a concrete `TargetStep` and resolve any job-level or step-level `recovery_activity` into a cached activity spec.
5. Resolve every `backend: auto` in the now-concrete step tree.
6. Reject loop-body `session:` bindings that resolve to `backend: cli`.
7. Build audit sinks and run id with `system` as the v2 envelope `agent_identity`.
8. Execute the normalized `JobV2`.

The target-ref pass was added in [T20260418-2019], backend resolution and `run-v2` entrypoints in [T20260418-2143], and CLI backend plus HTTP-only loop/session rejection in [T20260419-0104].

The public CLI now executes activity assets through jobs rather than exposing a standalone `orbit activity run` subcommand. `orbit activity` is an inspection/catalog surface; `orbit job run` and workflow aliases under `orbit run` are the public execution surfaces after [T20260426-0047].

Some module comments still describe older phase ordering; the authoritative behavior is the orbit-core call path in `crates/orbit-core/src/command/job/exec.rs`.

Seeded direct shipment workflows (`task_local_pipeline` and `task_pr_pipeline`) opt into `recovery_activity: step_failure_recovery` on specific steps after [T20260430-14]. Activity routing has one mechanism after [ORB-10622]: a rendered `crew` input selects that crew, and an activity without one uses the run's resolved crew. `step_failure_recovery` opts into `workflow.system_crew`; the executor renders that configured name into its activity input before resolution. Activity and job assets declaring the retired `role` key fail to load with guidance to use `crew`. The recovery agent receives only the executor-provided recovery keys, inspects the failed step, makes bounded repairs when safe, and returns before the executor's single post-recovery attempt. Higher-level orchestration workflows do not enable the hook because replaying child-run dispatch or planning orchestration is not a safe default recovery action.

After [ORB-10382], the recovery activity's structured result is **advisory only**, and its `output_schema_json` declares no `required` fields to keep it that way. A `recovery_activity` is a step attribute rather than a step, so it has no step id and no `{{ steps.<id>.output.* }}` template can consume it; `attempt_recovery_activity` gates the executor's single post-recovery attempt on the dispatch succeeding, never on a returned field (`recovered` is not read anywhere). Recovery's real outcome therefore lives in durable state — the repaired worktree, the persisted task record, the pushed branch, the PR that either exists or does not. Marking a reporting field `required` would let a truncated or malformed agent result invalidate a repair that already happened, which is why the field set stays optional.

After [ORB-10499], that post-recovery attempt is identified as the source of the "duplicate implement invocation" reported in [F2026-07-174], and an implement invocation can now cancel itself once its task stops accepting writes. The audit trail of the reported run settles the dispatch question the friction could not: the two `implement_one` invocations were serial and deliberate, not concurrent. Attempt #1 exited 0 with `timed_out: false` and was classified `error`, `step_failure_recovery` reported success, `step.recovery_attempted` fired, and attempt #2 ran 848s to completion — after which `commit` reported `skipped_no_diff_expected`. So there is no double-dispatch bug and no retry-after-perceived-timeout policy, only the executor's bounded post-recovery attempt working as designed. Why attempt #2's work was unpersistable is a separate fact the friction conflated with the first: the task's own history shows `status_changed` and then `review_approved` landing *inside* attempt #2's window, attributable to no step of the run — `promote_no_diff` did not run until the end — and recorded against actor `unknown`, so which actor promoted it is not recoverable from the evidence and is deliberately not asserted. What both halves share is one assumption: that an implement invocation is the only actor on its task for the duration of its run. The executor assumes a step classified as failed leaves its task untouched, and the agent assumes its dispatch-time envelope stays valid until its final write. The fix keeps the re-dispatch — most failed attempts do leave the task unfinished — and instead makes the invocation able to see its situation. `agent_task_context_json` injects `status` and `terminal` into the `task` envelope (`terminal` mirroring the `update_task` write gate, where `Done` refuses every non-comment mutation and `Archived` refuses everything but a bare restore), and `agent_implement`'s instruction opens with a terminal-task precheck that stops before resolving context files and returns `success` with `skipped_reason: "task_terminal"`. Because the reported task went terminal mid-run, the dispatch-time snapshot alone is not sufficient: the contract also requires re-reading status through `orbit.task.show` at each checkpoint where the remaining work is still expensive, and treats a terminal-status write rejection as a stop rather than something to retry around. The guard is advisory in the sense of [L-0115] — the executor still gates on durable state and still pays subprocess startup — and an engine-side claim/lock refusing the re-dispatch outright was rejected both as hard-coding a task-lifecycle judgment into the generic step executor and as ineffective here, since the task was still `in-progress` when attempt #2 was dispatched.

After [ORB-10306], retry classification and recovery eligibility are separate decisions. `WorktreeIntegrity` still bypasses ordinary retry and backoff, but an explicitly configured step- or job-level recovery activity receives its complete rendered diagnostic and may run exactly once before the executor's single post-recovery attempt. Without configured recovery—or when recovery or that post-recovery attempt fails—the original integrity error is preserved and the executor performs no automatic checkout reconciliation. Other non-retryable error classes remain ineligible for recovery.

After [ORB-10232], `task_pr_pipeline` exposes the PR handoff as ordered durable checkpoints: `commit` (`git_commit`), `prepare_branch` (`pr_prepare`), `sync_base` (`git_rebase`), `push` (`git_push`), `pr_open`, and `promote_tasks` (`pr_promote`). The no-diff-expected path skips the remote phases and uses its own promotion checkpoint. Each performed activity returns a `phase` and `decision`, so persisted step output distinguishes work performed on the first attempt from a current/skipped phase or a recovered/reused phase; job recovery audit records the recovery decision around the one retried step. `pr_open` no longer commits, rebases, pushes, or mutates task lifecycle state.

After [ORB-10380] / [ADR-0251], the base a run was created at is a pinned commit, not a name. `worktree_setup` resolves its start point once, creates the worktree at that commit, and emits `base_sha` alongside `base_ref`; both task pipelines pass `base_sha` into `commit`. After [ORB-10519] / [ADR-0299], `commit` rejects a ref name in `input.base_sha` and compares the resolved immutable commit directly with HEAD without traversing provider-created history. A mismatch is a typed `worktree_head_changed` failure; the provider boundary should already have rejected it. ADR-0219's `no-diff-expected` carve-out remains reachable before changed-HEAD and empty-stage failures, and no failure path stages or resets another checkout. `base_ref` still flows as the moving name to `sync_base` and `pr_open`, which remain the reconciliation with a base that moved.

The provider boundary now admits only worktree-file changes from an implementation provider. Any assigned HEAD or branch movement is a typed `worktree_content_conflict` regardless of commit count, message trailers, or changed paths; Orbit does not try to prove that provider history belongs to the task. `git_commit` stages the task worktree diff, creates exactly one workflow-owned commit, and returns that SHA. It never enumerates or adopts commits above the pinned base, parses `Agent-*` trailers, or validates a commit against `context_files`.

`pr_prepare` is the pre-rewrite authority boundary. It records the exact head SHA, base SHA, and observed remote task-branch SHA before `git_rebase` may rewrite history. `git_push` classifies the remote ref as missing, current, fast-forwardable, remote-ahead, or diverged. Missing and fast-forwardable refs use normal push; current refs are reused; remote-ahead refs fail closed. Divergence may use force-with-lease only when the persisted preparation SHA still exactly matches the observed remote SHA and `git_rebase` reports a performed or recovery-reused rewrite. The underlying tool emits a branch-scoped `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<expected-sha>`, so a concurrent remote update rejects the push instead of overwriting it. This is [ADR-0225].

After [ORB-10363], `JobV2.failure_activity` is a terminal, best-effort hook distinct from retry recovery. It receives the merged job input, all completed pipeline checkpoints, the failing step/action, and the structured error; it runs once and never replaces the original failure. `task_pr_pipeline` binds this hook to `pr_failure_handoff` ([ADR-0246]). That deterministic action aborts an active conflicting rebase back to the prepared branch, commits any remaining dirty candidate without passing through the normal success-only promotion gate, performs the existing non-overwriting push classification, and opens or reuses a blocked PR. A conflict PR body names the original and target base SHAs plus the conflicting paths, and the task moves to `blocked` with `pr_conflict_blocked` rather than `review`.

After [ORB-10385] / [ADR-0252], a job's reachable deterministic actions are checked against the executing runtime before its first step runs. `RuntimeHost::has_deterministic_action` reports the shared typed registry; `validate_job_deterministic_actions` walks the job's `recovery_activity`, `failure_activity`, every step's `recovery_activity`, and every resolved deterministic target (recursing through `parallel:`, `fan_out:`, and `loop:`) and fails the run with `DeterministicActionUnavailable` naming both the activity and the action. Because the check runs inside `execute_job_with_resume` ahead of step one, the run never reaches `worktree_setup`, so no task is admitted and no worktree is created. Unknown actions are never skipped, and the default trait implementation reports `true`, so a host that cannot enumerate its registry keeps surfacing the miss at dispatch. The gate does not weaken the failure hook: an action that becomes unavailable after admission still leaves the original failed-step error authoritative.

[ORB-10630] centralizes action names and core-versus-engine ownership in `orbit-common` ([ADR-0337], Proposed). The generated typed enums now derive core's advertised capability check and its engine forwarding path, while the engine matches its ownership-specific enum exhaustively. A declared action without its matching core or engine implementation therefore fails compilation rather than becoming runtime registry skew; an implementation cannot name an undeclared typed action. The duplicated dispatch-table assertion and standalone core asset scan were removed because they only compared duplicate lists. Catalog coverage remains: shipped YAML action strings are external inputs and must still be checked against the generated registry.

The linked-worktree boundary guard now treats a clean same-branch primary fast-forward as concurrent base movement, not provider escape. The assigned checkout retains its own HEAD, so the later `pr_prepare`/`git_rebase` checkpoints reconcile that movement. Primary resets, force-moves, and branch switches surface as `primary_checkout_drift`; inadmissible history or branch movement inside the assigned worktree surfaces as `worktree_content_conflict`. Conflict diagnostics report `run_changed_paths`, `primary_changed_paths`, and their `conflicting_paths` separately instead of presenting the primary's entire moved set as the task's conflict.

Before any dirty integrity failure leaves the boundary, Orbit writes content-bearing recovery evidence under the repository Git common directory at `orbit/worktree-recovery/<run-id>/`: `tracked.patch` is a binary/full-index diff against the recorded HEAD, `untracked/` mirrors every untracked file payload, and `manifest.json` records the task, run, HEAD, branch, and payload inventory. The typed diagnostic names those paths. Because the Git common directory survives forced removal of a linked worktree, an operator can recreate a checkout at `recordedHead`, apply `tracked.patch` with `git apply --binary`, and copy the untracked payload back even after pipeline cleanup.

After [ORB-10471] / [ADR-0292], whether primary working-content counts against that fast-forward is decided by interference with the run, not by byte-identity of the whole primary dirty state. The guard derives `primary_dirt_paths` — the paths whose index entry, index-to-worktree patch, worktree presence, or untracked blob identity actually moved — deliberately excluding the HEAD-relative `staged_patch_sha256`, which a fast-forward alone rewrites for every already-dirty path. `conflicting_paths` is that dirt intersected with `run_changed_paths`, so a merged sibling PR touching a file the run also touched stays base movement rather than a conflict. A fast-forward is accepted only when it is a proven same-branch ancestor advance *and* that intersection is empty; the ignored dirt is named in the acceptance log as `ignored_primary_paths` and in every drift diagnostic as `primary_dirt_paths`. This closes friction F2026-07-139, where one unrelated untracked primary file turned a benign base advance into `primary_checkout_drift` after valid implementation.

PR creation is restartable within its own checkpoint. `pr_open` first looks up the open PR by head branch; only the explicit no-PR result permits `github.pr.create`. If creation succeeds but PR view or local step-output persistence fails, the retry finds that same external PR and returns it as reused. `pr_promote` then idempotently applies the GitHub PR external ref and the per-task implementation attribution before moving tasks to `review`.

The seeded `list_backlog_tasks` deterministic activity starts `task_auto_pipeline`. Automatic mode admits tasks by `status: backlog`. It emits `task_count`, `task_ids`, `tasks`, singleton `bundles`, and an `excluded` array for admitted backlog tasks filtered because their context files overlap `in-progress` or `review` locks. `excluded` covers only lock overlap; status-based admission and `max_tasks` truncation stay silent, and explicit `task_ids` mode omits it. This attribution contract was added in [T20260421-0542-2].

`task_gate_pipeline` reserves a bundle's context files before it dispatches `task_pr_pipeline` or `task_local_pipeline` through `invoke_and_wait`. The reservation owner is the gate run that executed `reserve_locks`, not the child shipment run. Seeded defaults keep `ttl_seconds` aligned with `dispatch_timeout_seconds` at 7200 seconds, so the admission reservation covers the full child wait budget; workspace overrides must preserve `ttl_seconds >= dispatch_timeout_seconds` [T20260427-36]. Owned reservations are engine-cleaned when that owner run reaches a terminal state (`success`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `timeout`), so correctness does not depend on every workspace override preserving a YAML release step. The seeded deterministic `release_locks` activity still calls `orbit.task.locks.release` after a terminal child wait as an early-release optimization; idempotent terminal cleanup then finds nothing left to release. After [T20260427-34], `invoke_and_wait` remains a raw child-status join primitive, and seeded shipment parents use `pipeline_success_guard` to fail after required cleanup whenever a child run reports anything other than `succeeded`. `task_gate_pipeline` guards the direct child after release; `task_auto_pipeline` guards collected gate results after fan-in and skips that guard for an empty backlog. Unowned/manual reservations remain explicit-release-or-TTL only. TTL is the fallback for abandoned/manual reservations or cases where no terminal cleanup or reserve-pressure reconciliation trigger runs. This lifecycle was tightened in [T20260430-26] and made engine-owned in [T20260505-10].

`reserve_locks` checks dependency edges before locks, and after [ORB-10593] / [ADR-0319] it splits them by whether waiting can ever help. A dependency that has not reached `done` but still could — `proposed`, `backlog`, `in-progress`, `review`, `blocked`, `someday` — yields `reserved: false` with `waiting_on_deps` populated, and the gate's `wait_for_window` loop polls as before. A dependency that can never reach `done` — `archived`, `rejected`, or an ID that resolves to no task at all — fails the activity on the first call with a `task.dependencies.unsatisfiable:` error naming each blocked task, its offending dependency, that dependency's status, and the remedy. Both branches publish `waiting_on_deps` (empty on the lock path) so the pipeline can reference `steps.reserve.output.waiting_on_deps` unconditionally, and `gate_starvation_fail` now reports it alongside `conflicting_files` — a dependency-starved bundle previously timed out naming no blocker on either axis. What counts as *satisfied* is unchanged and stays `done`-only: this is a failure-reporting change, not a widening of admission. Note that the separate epic-rollup predicate `is_feature_child_terminal_status` still folds `archived` and `review` into `"done"`; it answers a different question (should this child be dispatched again?) and was deliberately left unconverged.

The HTTP epic pipeline layer — the `task_epic_pipeline` job, its `epic_orchestrator` activity, and the deterministic `pipeline_wait` join — was removed as unused in [ORB-10332]. The live gate/auto/PR/workspace-ship pipelines retain `invoke_and_wait` and the `orbit.pipeline.invoke` / `orbit.pipeline.wait` tools for child dispatch and joining.

Reserve conflict checking also performs bounded, opportunistic stale-owned-reservation reconciliation before reporting reservation conflicts. It inspects only overlapping owned reservations under current reserve pressure; it is not a background sweeper. Existing job-run list/show reconciliation remains in place, and both paths release run-owned reservations with `release_reason: stale_run_reconciled` when they prove the owner is already terminal or stale. Release audit rows use the task-lock audit surface and include `reservation_id`, `owner_run_id` when present, and `release_reason` (`explicit`, `run_terminal`, `stale_run_reconciled`, or TTL expiration).

## 5. Backend Resolution and Constraint Rules

`Backend::Auto` is never supposed to reach dispatch. orbit-core resolves it once per run using the precedence chain implemented in `backend_resolver.rs`:

1. `--backend=<value>`
2. `ORBIT_BACKEND`
3. `[runtime] backend = "<value>"` in config
4. hard-coded fallback `http`

If any intermediate tier says `auto`, the resolver folds it to the hard-coded fallback so dispatch only sees `http` or `cli`. That rule arrived with `run-v2` in [T20260418-2143] and was hardened for CLI in [T20260419-0104].

The second rule is the HTTP-only feature constraint. Today that means loop-body cross-iteration `session:` binding: `validate_job_loop_session_backends(...)` rejects a `loop:` step with `session:` when it resolves to `backend: cli`.

The third rule is no silent provider fallback. `backend: http` against an unwired provider fails as `UnwiredHttpTransport` rather than launching a CLI runtime; providers and backends are separate schema choices.

The prescriptive contract for this area lives in [specs/backend-resolution.md](./specs/backend-resolution.md).

---

## 6. Engine-Core Boundary

Activity / Job is where orbit-core hands work to orbit-engine without depending on `orbit-agent` types.

After [ORB-10633] / [ADR-0341], `RuntimeHost` is the single capability boundary and `OrbitRuntime` has one implementation. It presents run/task persistence, environment resolution, provider dispatch, audit/checkpoint hooks, and core-owned deterministic actions in one declaration; no parallel host-trait family remains.

- run a core-owned deterministic action by name
- source an API key for a provider
- resolve a provider's CLI executor command plus static args
- build `ToolContext` for an activity, including policy, filesystem audit hooks, and trusted reservation-owner context from the active run id
- persist invocation traces for completed agent-loop work

The boundary remains primitive — strings, `Value`, and `ToolContext`, not `orbit-agent` transport objects.

`dispatch_v2_activity(...)` is the central per-activity entry. It emits `ActivityStarted` / `ActivityFinished` envelope events, then delegates by spec kind:

- `agent_loop` → HTTP or CLI path
- `deterministic` → parse the shared typed action once; core-owned actions cross `RuntimeHost`, while engine-owned actions enter their engine implementation directly

For example, `git_commit` now follows dispatcher → `execute_engine_action` → the engine's commit implementation, whose runtime needs cross `RuntimeHost` once. It no longer follows dispatcher → core registry → engine forwarding → the former second host family. Task workflow-admission policy likewise has one owner in orbit-core: the read-only gate and mutating admission share the same status predicate, and worktree setup makes one mutating admission call per task.

---

## 7. Agent Loop Backend Paths

### 7.1 HTTP path

The HTTP path is driven by `agent_loop_driver.rs`. It:

- creates or reuses a `Session`
- constructs a `ToolContext`
- chooses a transport
- runs `orbit-agent`'s `AgentLoop`

This path is narrower than the schema: `Provider::has_http_transport()` currently returns true only for `claude`, so non-replay uses `AnthropicMessagesTransport`. Default builds ignore `ORBIT_V2_REPLAY` and `ORBIT_V2_REPLAY_FIXTURE`; scripted replay is enabled for explicit smoke and fixture use only when orbit-engine's `replay` cargo feature is selected ([ORB-10414]).

Because the feature is default-off, **any crate with a replay-fixture-backed test must opt in itself** — a test that merely sets `ORBIT_V2_REPLAY_FIXTURE` silently falls through to the live Anthropic transport and fails on a credential-free runner. orbit-core does this via its own `replay` feature, which forwards to `orbit-engine/replay` and gates `runtime/v2_host/tests/v2_host_replay.rs`. `scripts/ci-guardrails.sh` lints and runs the opt-in configuration for orbit-engine and orbit-core in one extra pass (`--features orbit-core/replay`), so both the default and replay configurations stay covered ([ORB-10434]).

The allowlist is enforced in the loop engine on this path. A denied tool becomes a structural `DispatchError::ToolDenied` so the job retry wrapper can classify it as non-retryable.

After [T20260426-0526], completed HTTP loop outcomes become `InvocationTrace` records under the job run ID and step ID, including loop-body `session:` steps.

### 7.2 CLI path

The CLI path is driven by `cli_runner.rs`, added in [T20260419-0104]. The flow is:

1. Ask the host for the concrete CLI executor: command plus static executor args.
2. Build an `Agent` from `orbit-agent`.
3. Ask the retained CLI runtime for an `AgentInvocationSpec` containing provider-specific per-request args.
4. Emit the advisory `ToolAllowlistHarnessDelegated` event.
5. Resolve the subprocess cwd from runtime-owned workspace context.
6. Emit `CliInvocationStarted` with redacted argv, stdin blob ref, and resolved cwd.
7. Spawn the subprocess in that cwd with a wall-clock timeout.
8. Emit `CliInvocationFinished` with stdout/stderr blob refs and timeout state.
9. Parse the captured provider output with the existing Orbit response parser and persist its `InvocationTrace` through the host. After [ORB-10231] / [ADR-0224], envelope parsing is best-effort by default: provider exit status and timeout determine transport success while durable task/review/git artifacts remain authoritative. A valid envelope still projects its result fields, and an invalid or absent envelope is retained as bounded/redacted diagnostic metadata. Activities whose downstream templates require response fields set `require_response_envelope: true`, preserving fail-closed validation for that explicit contract.
10. Apply the step-completion protocol check ([ORB-10449]) — see §7.6a.

### 7.6a Step-completion protocol vs. response content

[ORB-10231] / [ADR-0224] left one flag carrying two unrelated questions, and the
second one went unasked. `require_response_envelope: false` was read as "this
activity's response does not matter", when what it actually means is "nothing
downstream *consumes* this activity's response". Whether the invocation ran its
contract to the end is a different question, and nothing was asking it.

[ORB-10449] splits them:

| Flag | Question | Default | Reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `require_completion_envelope` | Did the invocation finish? | `true` | envelope *frame* only |
| `require_response_envelope` | Can downstream templates trust the fields? | `false` | full envelope incl. `result` |

The completion check (`response_envelope_protocol_check` in `orbit-agent`) asks
only whether stdout carried a well-formed Orbit response envelope: present,
`schemaVersion: 1`, and one of the three protocol status tokens. It never reads
`result` or `error`, and it does not care *which* status was declared — an agent
that reports `status: "failed"` completed its contract exactly as much as one
that reports success. **This keeps the doctrine intact**: agent-loop output stays
advisory, and no job or activity decision reads its content. "Did the contract
complete" is a property of the invocation, not a claim the agent makes about its
work.

Every `backend: cli` invocation is prompted with the response-envelope contract
(`render_prompt_with_embedded_envelope`), so exiting 0 without one is a protocol
violation, not a stylistic choice. The check applies only under `backend: cli`;
`backend: http` is driven by the engine's own loop, which has its own
termination accounting.

Deliberate asymmetry: the completion check is *more* permissive than the content
parser about stream shape. When the document stream will not parse — a wrapped
tool writing to the same stdout, a stray warning line — it falls back to scanning
the raw text for an embedded envelope. Failing a step that genuinely completed,
over stdout tidiness, would be a worse defect than the one this check exists to
catch.

**Failure semantics.** A violation fails the step exactly as an opted-in envelope
failure does: `DispatchOutcome { success: false }` with a message naming the step
and the violation. Concretely, for `implement_one` in `task_pr_pipeline`:

- **Not retried.** The step has no `retry:` block, and a repeat invocation of a
  stalled agent has no new information to work with.
- **No recovery agent.** `recovery_activity` fires on `Err`, not on a failed
  outcome — which is the behaviour we want here. `step_failure_recovery` exists
  to repair the *delivery path for completed work*; a stalled implementer is
  incomplete work, and having it publish the candidate is the opposite of the fix.
- **Run terminalizes at that step.** No later step runs, the step is audited as
  `failed`, and the job-level `failure_activity` (`pr_failure_handoff`,
  [ADR-0246]) still fires to preserve recoverable work.
- **Task and worktree.** The worktree is retained with whatever the agent wrote
  before it stopped; tasks coupled to the run move to `blocked` under the normal
  terminal-run rules. Re-dispatch is an orchestrator decision, not an automatic
  one.

The durable `execution_summary` delivery gate ([ORB-10313] / [ADR-0236]) is
unchanged and remains the last line. Nothing here weakens it or bypasses it —
this check simply means a stalled implementer no longer reaches it.

After [ORB-10603] / [ADR-0326], the gate is also no longer reachable in the
ordinary case, because the commit step fills the field it reads. When — and only
when — durable state carries no meaningful summary, `commit_batch_changes`
derives one from `git status` in the delivery worktree (the same file set
`git add --all` will stage), persists it to the task record with an
`execution_summary_derived` event, and then meets the unchanged gate. The
derivation reads durable, re-checkable state and never the agent's advisory
response envelope ([L-0115]); an agent-authored summary is always preserved; and
a worktree with nothing to describe still yields no summary and is still
refused.

**Declared exceptions.** No shipped `agent_loop` activity opts out of
`require_completion_envelope`. Every seeded agent step performs work whose
absence must stop the pipeline, so the empty opt-out list is pinned by a test
and any future exception requires a deliberate edit with a stated reason.

After [T20260426-2313], stdout/stderr readers emit line-level `tracing::info!` events while the child runs, carrying `provider`, `stream`, `job_run_id`, `task_id`, and `line`. After [T20260508-8], those events also carry `cwd` when the CLI subprocess has a resolved cwd. After [T20260426-2349], the default tracing subscriber redacts formatted output. The readers still retain original bytes for the existing audit/blob path, so run logs follow blob refs rather than the live feed.

Executor args are prepended before provider runtime args. For seeded Codex, the subprocess starts as `codex exec --json ...`, not the interactive TUI. [T20260423-0114] exposed the earlier command-only boundary.

After [T20260427-48], provider runtime args receive provider config through `RuntimeHost`. Static executor definitions keep command-shape flags (`exec --json`); dynamic Codex settings such as sandbox mode, side-write roots, and approval policy stay in the retained provider runtime. Codex approval policy is an exec-compatible config override, not the interactive-only `--ask-for-approval` flag.

After [T20260427-51], macOS CLI invocations declaring `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` run under `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -f <profile.sb> <provider> ...`; [T20260509-30] made that wrapper resolution trusted and absolute instead of `PATH`-based. Orbit treats that SBPL profile as filesystem authority and neutralizes provider-native sandbox flags. After [T20260428-10], the profile grants Codex state (`$CODEX_HOME` or `$HOME/.codex`) plus side-write roots from provider config so inherited Orbit subprocesses can persist workflow state while project writes remain governed by `fsProfile`. After [T20260505-22], dispatch also runs `apply_provider_static_arg_fixups` before spawn, separately from sandbox neutralization. Today this only rewrites Claude's `--debug-file` value to `<claude_state_dir>/<basename>` so the log lands inside the already-writable state dir instead of `.orbit/**`, which the default policy denies.

After [T20260509-40], bare Unix CLI subprocesses enter their own process group, matching the macOS sandbox wrapper's kill boundary. The supervisor kills that process group on timeout, also kills any remaining group members after the main child exits before joining output readers, and bounds timeout-path reader joins so a leaked pipe writer cannot hang the activity supervisor. Non-Unix platforms keep the immediate-child kill fallback until Orbit has an equivalent process-tree primitive there.

After [ORB-10456], every bare provider launcher is resolved before audit and
spawn at the shared `orbit-engine` CLI boundary ([ADR-0259]). Lookup preserves
configured paths verbatim; bare names search the process `PATH` first, then
portable user-local directories derived from `HOME` (`.local/bin`,
`.orbit/bin`, `.cargo/bin`, and `bin`). Dashboard Ship, routine sweep,
`orbit run ship`, and direct job execution all converge on this boundary, so
none depends solely on the environment inherited by its entry process. A
missing launcher remains a permanent failure, but the diagnostic names the
provider and every path Orbit searched.

After [T20260430-15], the CLI stdin envelope carries rendered activity input and durable `run_id` beside instruction, prompt, tools, and model. When input identifies one task, orbit-core embeds a canonical task snapshot with `input.workspace_path` / `input.repo_root` taking precedence over stored paths. After [T20260508-8], `backend: cli` also uses a shared workspace resolver for subprocess cwd: `input.workspace_path`, then `task.workspace_path`, then best-effort `ToolContext.workspace_root`. Declared input/task paths must already be directories; stale worktrees fail as `CliInvocationFailed` before `CliInvocationStarted` is emitted. After [T20260505-10], Orbit-managed CLI subprocesses receive `ORBIT_RUN_ID` plus an Orbit-managed run-context marker; `orbit tool run` requires both before it populates `ToolContext` reservation ownership. Direct manual CLI tool calls, including calls with only `ORBIT_RUN_ID`, remain unowned.

The older `AgentRuntime` trait and `providers/*_cli.rs` files are not deprecated leftovers; they are the shipped `backend: cli` implementation.

Just as important, Orbit does not enforce tool allowlists on this path today. It records the declared tool set as an advisory and delegates enforcement to the provider harness. This is a real semantic gap between `backend: http` and `backend: cli`.

## 8. Job Execution Semantics

The executor implementation lives under `crates/orbit-engine/src/activity_job/job_executor/` after [T20260509-2]. `mod.rs` owns the public exports and run entrypoint, while responsibility-focused child modules own audit projection, execution context, templating, step retry/recovery, target dispatch, parallel/fan-out/loop constructs, validation, and the small fan-out semaphore. The outward `activity_job::job_executor::{JobOutcome, execute_job_with_resume, resolve_job_catalog_refs_for_execution, validate_job}` surface is the supported execution API; the former non-resume convenience wrapper was removed as unreachable cleanup in [ORB-10629].

### 8.1 Template rendering and pipeline context

The executor exposes outputs as `{{ steps.<id>.output.* }}`. Initial context follows the §3 merge contract: object caller input overlays object `job.default_input`, while `null` and non-object inputs keep their special cases. Step `default_input` is rendered recursively; strings that parse as JSON convert back into `Value`.

`fan_out` workers see `{{ item }}` / `{{ input.item }}`. Loop bodies see `{{ input.iteration }}`.

#### Agent-step state handoff via `orbit.state.*`

Agents running inside an activity step pass durable data to later steps through `orbit.state.*`, not through the step's response payload. Treat direct-agent stdout as an audit/diagnostic stream — downstream steps must read durable data from task artifacts, `orbit.state.*`, job-run state, or purpose-built tools, not by parsing agent process output. The contract:

- `orbit.state.get` reads the persisted pipeline snapshot.
- `orbit.state.set` writes this step's output for the engine to merge after the step finishes.
- Once needed fields are written to `orbit.state`, the activity itself usually has no structured response-payload requirement.
- `orbit.task.update` stays the right tool for task artifacts (`execution_summary`, `pr_status`, comments, lifecycle state). That is task persistence, not pipeline-state handoff.
- `orbit.state.*` is only callable when the activity allowlist includes those tools. Currently only [step_failure_recovery](../../../crates/orbit-core/assets/activities/step_failure_recovery.yaml) grants them; other activities thread data through `{{ steps.<id>.output.* }}` or purpose-built tools.

### 8.2 `when` and `retry`

`when` is evaluated once, before retry. A skipped step is a successful no-op and does not retry.

After [T20260509-11], the shipped condition grammar remains equality-only (`==` / `!=`, combined with `&&` / `||`); skip-on-empty guards express emptiness as `!= 0` or `!= []` rather than numeric comparisons, preserving the `orbit run ship` auto-mode empty-backlog no-op behavior.

The retry wrapper re-runs the whole step body up to `max_attempts`, with exponential or linear backoff. Some errors bypass retry:

- tool denial
- unknown deterministic action
- host-required / backend-resolution structural errors
- job validation errors

That rule comes straight from `DispatchError::is_non_retryable()`.

### 8.3 `parallel`

Parallel branches run under `std::thread::scope`. Join policy is:

- `all`
- `any`
- `quorum { n }`

The executor emits `StepJoin` with per-branch outcomes. If the join policy fails and any branch produced a structural error, the first error is surfaced instead of only `success: false`.

### 8.4 `fan_out` / `fan_in`

`fan_out.items` is template-rendered into an array. Workers run concurrently behind a counting semaphore, so `max_workers` is a true concurrency bound, not just metadata. `fan_in.collect` can persist the ordered worker outputs under a separate pipeline key in addition to the step id itself.

Workers use isolated pipeline/session maps. The validator rejects any worker template with `session:` because concurrent workers would otherwise share one mutable `Session`.

### 8.5 `loop`

A loop runs either:

- once per rendered `items` entry
- or up to `max_iterations` when `items` is absent

The body runs before `break_when`, so steps can populate fields the break expression reads. If `items` exceeds `max_iterations`, execution fails structurally instead of truncating.

### 8.6 Persisted state for v2 job runs

Persisted pipeline runs (`orbit run ship`, `orbit.pipeline.invoke` + `orbit.pipeline.wait`) go through `pipeline_run.rs`. Direct v2 runs (`orbit job run <job-id-or-yaml>`) also create durable `JobRun` bundles after [T20260423-2004-4] under `state/job-runs/<job_id>/<run_id>/`, so `orbit run history -j <job_id>` and `orbit run show <run_id>` can inspect the returned ID. Workflow-specific `orbit run <workflow> list/show` aliases were removed in [T20260425-2010], and duplicate job-level aliases in [T20260426-0742].

Before [T20260423-0445], early v2 failures could leave `steps: []` and no surfaced `error_message`. The current contract is:

- if a persisted v2 pipeline fails and no recorded step already carries error detail, the pipeline worker writes a synthetic failed `JobRunStep`
- if a direct v2 run succeeds, the direct-run wrapper writes a synthetic successful `JobRunStep` containing the final pipeline snapshot
- that synthetic step uses `target_type: job` and `target_id: <job_id>`
- the step's `error_message` carries the concrete executor error (or a fallback `success=false` summary for message-carrying non-success results)

This operator-surface repair keeps `orbit run ship --json`, direct `orbit job run`, `orbit run history`, and `orbit run show` actionable without adding a second run-level error channel.

After [T20260430-27], the former `orbit run ship-auto` path interpreted the parent `task_auto_pipeline` snapshot for operator output. Text and JSON modes kept the persisted run state and exit-code semantics, but added `workflow_status` labels: `empty_backlog`, `gated_noop`, `gate_waiting`, `gate_failed`, and `completed`. `empty_backlog` means no candidates and no exclusions. `gated_noop` means zero dispatched bundles with one or more `list_backlog.excluded` entries. `gate_waiting` means a child `task_gate_pipeline` run is still pending/running or the parent wait timed out while the child remains active. `gate_failed` means a child gate run reached a failed or cancelled state. After [ORB-00075], `orbit run ship` is the single public shipment command: omitted task IDs run auto mode, provided task IDs seed explicit singleton bundles, and both forms submit `task_auto_pipeline` asynchronously. The dispatch output is now just workflow/job/run identity plus pointers to `orbit run history -j task_auto_pipeline` and `orbit run show <RUN_ID>`; waiting reasons and terminal details live on those durable inspection surfaces rather than in CLI dispatch output.

After [T20260505-8], active job runs can be cancelled through the same durable run surface. `pending` and `running` runs transition to `cancelled`; terminal runs remain immutable. Pending cancellation only rewrites the run bundle and pipeline snapshot, so a later pipeline worker observes `cancelled` and exits without claiming the run. Running cancellation first validates the stored owner PID start-time token, then signals the owner process group on Unix with a bounded graceful period and `SIGKILL` escalation. `JobRunCancelled` audit payloads include run id, previous/final state, actor/source, whether signaling was attempted, and the signal outcome.

After [T20260505-21], whole-run replay creates a fresh durable `JobRun` from an existing run's persisted input and the current catalog job definition. Replay never mutates the source run bundle or source audit envelope; lineage lives on the new run as `retry_source_run_id` and in the new v2 `run.started` audit envelope. This is intentionally whole-run only: every step executes from step 0, and changed or deleted job YAML is resolved at replay time rather than read from a source-run snapshot.

After [ORB-10002], the executor also persists per-step recovery checkpoints, and interrupted runs are resumable. After each completed *top-level* step, `execute_job_with_resume` calls `RuntimeHost::checkpoint_step`, which orbit-core records into the run's existing persisted `PipelineState` (`step_states`, `step_outputs`, `next_step_index`, plus the cumulative step-output pipeline snapshot) — no new table; the checkpoint store is the `pipeline_state_json` column that already backs run state. Checkpoint failures are non-fatal (a `tracing` warning; the run continues without durability). Orphan reconciliation — which already probed `pid` + `pid_start_time` owner identity on run list/show/exec and now also runs best-effort at workspace open (`OrbitRuntime::from_resolved_roots`) — finalizes conclusively-dead-owner `running` runs to a new terminal `interrupted` state (`RunEvent::Interrupt`) instead of `failed`, with an `interrupted` diagnostic step carrying the liveness reason; inconclusive probes still leave the run alone. `orbit job resume <run_id>` accepts `interrupted` / `failed` / `timeout` runs and creates a fresh linked run (`retry_source_run_id`, `attempt + 1`) whose seeded `PipelineState` comes from the source's checkpoints: top-level steps recorded `success` are skipped (audited as `step.skipped` with a resume reason) and their outputs are fed back into the pipeline for later steps' templates. Checkpoint granularity is intentionally the top-level step — `parallel:` / `fan_out:` / `loop:` blocks re-run as a whole if incomplete — and in-memory agent sessions are not restored across processes. A source run with no successful checkpoint degrades to whole-run replay semantics.

After [ORB-10470] / [ADR-0289], resume is a durable *submission* scoped by explicit retry lineage. `OrbitRuntime::submit_resume_run` persists the resumed run seeded with the source's checkpoints and hands it to the same detached pipeline worker `submit_ship_run` uses, so `POST /job-runs/:id/resume` returns `{run_id, retry_source_run_id, state: submitted|queued}` as soon as the run is durable and the resumed pipeline never occupies a request thread; `orbit job resume` keeps the in-process foreground behavior. The pipeline worker takes its resume cursor from the run's *own* persisted `PipelineState`, which makes checkpoint reuse a property of the run record rather than of the caller and makes a worker restart idempotent — steps already recorded `success` are skipped, never re-dispatched. Before the first step runs, resume reconciles the tasks its lineage owns (the source run, its `retry_source_run_id` ancestors, and their descendants, narrowed by the run input's `task_ids` when present): a task blocked by that lineage's own failure is re-admitted to `in_progress`, and its `job_run_id` is realigned to the batch id the reused checkpoints carry (`steps.<worktree>.output.job_run_id`). This closes both halves of the F2026-07-122 catch-22 — checkpoint resume skips `worktree_setup`, so nothing else would re-claim the task — while leaving `load_handoff_context`'s ownership equality check untouched: a task owned by a run outside the lineage is never re-admitted or re-stamped, and whatever reconciliation cannot repair still fails closed at the delivery seam (F2026-07-121).

After [ORB-10631], all four ship surfaces — interactive `orbit run ship`, the dashboard endpoint, the MCP `orbit.workflow.ship` tool, and the deterministic routine action — enter `OrbitRuntime::submit_ship_run` before run insertion. Surface adapters still resolve their own request syntax and attribution, but the runtime owns canonical input construction, the in-flight explicit-task guard, pipeline audit emission, and durable job-run insertion. This keeps the CLI's output projection behavior while making the guard and every other submission check impossible to bypass by choosing a different front door.

After [ORB-10070], orphan reconciliation also covers `pending` runs. Pipeline workers claim their queued run at startup (`claim_pending_job_run_owner` records `pid` + start-time token while the run is still `pending`), so a queued run polling for its admission slot carries a probeable owner exactly like a running run. Reconcile finalizes a pending run as `interrupted` (`Pending + Interrupt` is now a legal transition) in two conclusive cases: its claimed owner is `Mismatch`/`Missing`, or it was never claimed and is older than a 30-minute grace window (covering workers that died before claiming and queued runs written by pre-claim binaries, e.g. stranded by a host reboot after their parent run was interrupted). Inconclusive probes and fresh unclaimed runs stay `pending`. `orbit doctor`'s `job-runs` check reports both orphan classes read-only, and `orbit run cancel <run_id>` gives operators a direct terminalization path.

After [ORB-10461], every detached pipeline worker appends stdout and stderr to the private run-addressable path `.orbit/state/logs/<run_id>.worker.log`. The parent-side startup observer records that path in claimed/failure audit events. If the child exits before setting its pending-run owner, the observer terminalizes the same run as `interrupted` and copies a redacted, bounded tail of the worker output into the synthetic diagnostic step; startup and action-registration errors are therefore inspectable by run id without waiting for the stale-run grace window. Normal claimed-worker execution and admission polling are unchanged.

The loop shares one pipeline map and session map across iterations, which makes cross-iteration `session:` meaningful.

### 8.7 Invocation metrics

The dashboard metrics endpoints read knowledge usage from job-run state (`/api/metrics/knowledge`) and agent, tool, task, and invocation usage from the SQLite invocation store (`/api/metrics/activity`, `/api/metrics/tools`, `/api/metrics/task/:id`, `/api/metrics/invocations`). They do not scrape `.orbit/state/audit/v2_loop/` or diagnostics JSONL.

V2 jobs persist invocation traces explicitly after [T20260426-0526]. `DispatchOutcome` carries optional trace data; the executor attaches run and step IDs; orbit-core stores canonical agent/model names plus task IDs from rendered input and refreshes the token scoreboard.

For `backend: cli`, the trace comes from the provider's structured stdout using the same parser that validates Orbit response envelopes. For the HTTP loop path, the trace is derived from `LoopOutcome` usage and tool-call names.

### 8.8 Run trace inspection

`orbit run show`, `logs`, `events`, and `trace` inspect already-scheduled runs and resolve an omitted run ID to the most recent run.

After [T20260426-0709], `orbit run show <run> -s <id>` treats the v2 envelope's activity DAG `step.id` as primary. This matters because durable v2 runs may store a synthetic job-level `JobRunStep`, while the envelope records actual YAML step IDs. `JobRunStep.target_id` and numeric `step_index` remain fallbacks.

After [T20260426-0705], `orbit run events <run>` reads the v2 envelope chronologically and filters by step ID or event type. `orbit run trace <run>` renders the parent/child tree from `event_id` and `parent_event_id`. JSON mode is deterministic.

The CLI does not own envelope storage. `orbit-core` exposes accessors for v2 audit events and CLI invocation records, including derived step IDs and blob-backed stdout/stderr, keeping storage knowledge with the runtime layer.

### 8.9 Workflow worktree base synchronization

Task-shipping workflows that create worktrees (`task_pr_pipeline`, `task_local_pipeline`, and callers such as `task_auto_pipeline`) default `base_sync` to `remote` after [T20260427-45]. Remote mode fetches `origin/<base_branch>` and creates or resets task worktrees at that remote-tracking ref, so every candidate starts from published history rather than a stale local base.

Direct callers can set `base_sync: local` for local-only repos or unpublished base branches. That mode resolves the local base ref and skips origin fetch.

The local pipeline deliberately separates those two moments after [ORB-10604]: worktree setup still honors the caller's sync mode, but its merge checkpoint always uses `base_sync: local`. A previous bundle can advance the shared local base and then fail during bookkeeping or publication; treating that in-session commit as the next merge's rebase target prevents one post-merge failure from turning every later bundle into the remote-mode "local base is ahead" refusal. Each retry re-resolves the current local base and rebases only its own worktree, so concurrent disjoint bundles converge through the existing fast-forward/rebase loop. Exhausted contention can still fail one bundle, but it does not poison the base for later local merges.

The remote-mode refusal remains part of `git_merge`: a caller that requests remote synchronization still fails when the local base carries commits absent from the fetched remote. Local mode is safe here by construction because the local pipeline owns the in-session base history. Publishing before bookkeeping was rejected as the general repair because local pipelines may intentionally run with `auto_push: false`; making publication unconditional would change the workflow's external-side-effect contract, while leaving it conditional would preserve the cascade for those sessions.

### 8.10 Workflow task admission

After [T20260428-8], task-starting workflows own explicit admission instead of relying on generic task updates. `worktree_setup` accepts `proposed`, `backlog`, `rejected`, and `archived` tasks into `in-progress`; existing `in-progress` tasks are idempotent retry inputs.

This path stays separate from `orbit.task.update` and generic deterministic metadata stamping. Direct task updates keep the non-empty-plan guard, and workflow admission records system-actor lifecycle history.

After [ORB-10464] / [ADR-0290], status is only half of readiness. `worktree_setup` also verifies that every dependency the task declares `done` has actually been delivered into the base it pins — the check runs after `base_sha` is resolved and before the worktree, the branch, or the `in-progress` transition exist, so a refusal leaves nothing behind. Delivery is decided by the `[ORB-NNNNN]` marker every Orbit commit message carries, since squash and rebase merges rewrite the sha but preserve the message: a dependency is refused only when the repository holds marked commits for it (`git log --all`, remote-tracking refs included) and none is reachable from `base_sha`. A dependency with no marked commit anywhere is not refused. The refusal is the typed `OrbitError::DependencyNotDelivered`, naming the task, the dependency, the base ref and sha, and the commits found elsewhere; `input.dependency_delivery: 'ignore'` disables the gate for work delivered under a different commit message. Nothing in the check reads GitHub, so PR-backed and local-only dependencies verify identically.


### 8.11 Task PR handoff summaries

`task_pr_pipeline` sends the selected task IDs to `pr_open` as `completed_task_ids`. Before `pr_open` pushes or creates the pull request, the deterministic action reloads each task record, checks that the task still belongs to the batch, confirms it can enter review, and requires a meaningful persisted `execution_summary` for every completed task. Empty, whitespace-only, and explicit placeholder summaries fail the PR step with an error naming the task id; generated default PR bodies also omit placeholder summary details blocks. When callers pass a non-empty `body`, `pr_open` preserves that body verbatim after the same durable-summary guard passes. This handoff contract was tightened in [T20260430-31].

After [T20260508-3], generated one-task PR bodies render the task contract first: `## Task`, optional collapsed `## Execution Summary`, `## Validation`, then `## Branch Freshness`. The task section includes the task link, description, and plain-bullet acceptance criteria so reviewers can see the requested work beside the implementation summary. Multi-task callers keep the legacy `## Tasks` plus files-changed layout until those paths are retired.

After [ORB-10644] / [ADR-0336], `pr_open` and `pr_promote` also ask whether the base itself can still carry the work. The base name flows from `input.base_branch` through `prepare_branch` and `sync_base` untouched, and `resolve_worktree_start_point` is satisfied by any `origin/<base>` that resolves, so a base that merged and was deleted — or was restored to its pre-merge tip — still passed every check while the merge never reached the branch work lands on. A base is refused when either (a) the repository has an `origin` remote and the base branch is gone from it, or (b) an `input.landing_branch` is declared, differs from the base, and the base carries nothing that branch does not already have: the pinned `base_sha` is an ancestor of the landing tip, or every commit unique to the base is already delivered there under its task marker. Test (b) reuses the same `[ORB-NNNNN]` marker rule as §8.10, lifted into `vcs::delivery_marker` so the dependency gate and the base gate share one definition; the pinned `base_sha` is the subject and only the landing branch is resolved live. The refusal is recorded as the `obsolete-base` handoff phase and names the stale base, the landing branch, the marker that already landed, and a recovery path. Ordinary non-stacked delivery is unaffected — with no `landing_branch`, or with it equal to the base, only the remote-existence probe runs — and `input.base_obsolescence: 'ignore'` disables the gate for a base deliberately kept off `origin` or one whose commits repeat an already-landed task id.

After [ORB-00016], `pr_open` treats a branch with zero commits ahead of the selected base as a successful no-repository-diff handoff after the same durable task guards pass. This path advances completed `in-progress` tasks to `review`, returns `pr_created: false` with base/head freshness fields, and does not call GitHub PR creation or stamp `github-pr` external refs. The normal branch-with-commits path still pushes, opens the PR, returns `pr_created: true`, and records the PR ref on participating tasks.

After [ORB-10313], the VCS handoff seam uses one shared durable predicate (`reject_failed_delivery`) to block a task whose first nonblank execution-summary line is exactly `Outcome: failed`; other meaningful summary shapes remain deliverable, while empty and placeholder summaries keep their existing rejection. The predicate is enforced at two points so both fresh and resumed delivery stop against an explicit durable failure. First, `commit_batch_changes` invokes it immediately after loading the single coupled task and before it resolves the delivery checkout, stages files, mutates the index, or creates a commit — covering both the PR and local task pipelines. Second, `load_handoff_context` invokes the same predicate, so every direct or resumed `pr_prepare`, rebase, push, `pr_open`, `pr_promote`, and no-diff promotion revalidates durable state and cannot deliver a task that now reports failure. This reads the durable task record only; it does not make the advisory agent response envelope authoritative and does not teach `pipeline_success_guard` to parse task prose. This gate closes friction F2026-07-091, where `task_pr_pipeline` published a PR whose durable summary began `Outcome: failed`. See [ADR-0236](./4_decisions.md#adr-0236--fail-delivery-before-git-mutation-when-execution-outcome-is-not-success).

### 8.12 Test surfaces guarding executor invariants

Risk-weighted regression tests live next to the executor modules they guard
under `crates/orbit-engine/src/activity_job/job_executor/tests/`
([T20260509-7]). Each executor-block module has a matching test module under
`tests/`, and each test names the specific invariant it guards in the function
name. The
current surface:

- `step.rs` (`step.rs`) — linear step success and pipeline propagation,
  failure short-circuit (mod.rs:131-148), retry `max_attempts` exhaustion,
  non-retryable bypass, success on intermediate attempt, and
  `compute_backoff_ms` linear/exponential monotonicity and cap behavior.
- `parallel.rs` (`parallel.rs`) — `JoinMode::All`, `JoinMode::Any`,
  `JoinMode::Quorum`, `StepJoin` audit event ordering, and audit
  parent-stack inheritance into branch threads.
- `fanout.rs` (`fan_out.rs`) — empty items emit `FanoutDispatched{0}`
  and `FaninJoined{0,0}`, collected outputs are spawn-index ordered even
  when workers complete out of order, `max_workers` semaphore caps
  in-flight workers, structural error surfaces under unsatisfied join,
  `fan_in.collect` writes the collected value under the alias key, and
  per-worker `WorkerState` events appear in `dispatched`→`finished` order.
- `loop.rs` (`loop_block.rs`) — `items` length over `max_iterations`
  errors, `break_when` exits with `LoopIterationEnd{broke=true}`,
  exhausting iterations emits `LoopDidNotConverge`, and the loop exits on
  first body failure.
- `pipeline_durability.rs` (`exec_ctx.rs`, `fan_out.rs:53-56`) —
  a step's output remains visible to later steps via
  `{{ steps.<id>.output.* }}`, and the pipeline snapshot taken into
  fan-out workers preserves upstream values past the fan-out boundary.

Shared host scaffolding (`ScriptedHost`, `Action`, job/step builders) lives
in `tests/mod.rs` so each block module stays focused on its own invariants.
New executor blocks must land with a matching test module under `tests/`
covering the analogous invariants — see [ADR-047](./4_decisions.md#adr-047--each-new-executor-block-ships-with-a-sibling-test-module).

## 9. Filesystem Policy and `fsProfile`

Both `ActivityV2` and `TargetStep` can attach an `fsProfile`. orbit-core uses `tool_context_for_activity(...)` to build the policy-aware `ToolContext`, and `V2AuditWriter` can attach filesystem audit logging so read/write denials appear in the envelope.

Runtime/CLI enforcement landed in [T20260419-0503]. `fsProfile` is therefore part of the activity/job contract, not a CLI presentation detail.

One subtlety: profile attachment happens at two layers.

- An activity asset may declare its own `fsProfile`.
- A target step may override or supply one around an inlined activity spec.

Readers must distinguish "profile on the reusable activity" from "profile on this call site."

## 10. Legacy Surfaces and Retention Boundaries

This feature spans a migration, so the retained surfaces are explicit.

### 10.1 Retention Table

| Surface | Current status | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `schemaVersion: 1` activity/job assets | Retired | Load-time hard error after [T20260419-2156]. |
| v2 `agent_loop` HTTP path | Kept | Canonical typed runtime path from [T20260418-2010]. |
| v2 `agent_loop` CLI path | Kept | Implemented by the retained `AgentRuntime` trait and `providers/*_cli.rs` after [T20260419-0104]. |
| `TargetRef` authoring form | Kept at authoring/load time only | Human-friendly YAML surface; resolved away before execution since [T20260418-2019]. |
| v1 `crate::job_runner` | Kept, condition grammar only | The older sequential/DAG runtime was removed in [ORB-10390]; the module now holds only `condition::evaluate_bool_expr`, consumed by the v2 executor's `when` and `break_when` evaluation (`job_executor/step.rs`, `job_executor/loop_block.rs`). |
| v1 executor stack (`ActivityExecutor`, `ActivityExecutorRegistry`, `direct_agent` / `external` / `cli_command` executors, v1 `ExecutionContext`, v1 `Activity`) | Removed | Deleted in [ORB-10395]. v2 dispatch consults no executor registry; executor defs are read only for provider CLI/sandbox resolution. |
| External Executor Protocol v1 (`executor_type: external`) | Removed | Never a supported surface; retired with the v1 stack in [ORB-10395]. `ExecutorType::External` still parses so pre-existing defs load, but nothing spawns them — see `docs/design/executors/4_decisions.md` §ADR-0196. |
| Legacy `run_parallel_task_pipeline` | Removed | The legacy parallel-batch executor was removed as unused in [ORB-10332]; the live pipelines still dispatch and join children through `orbit.pipeline.invoke` / `orbit.pipeline.wait`. |
| Seeded reference activities and jobs | Kept | They act as runnable contracts and examples, and were moved into init seeding in [T20260419-2347]. |

### 10.2 Seeded Assets in Practice

Seeded assets are part of the design. Today they include:

- small reference activities such as `agent_loop_reference` and `agent_loop_cli_reference`
- control-plane jobs such as `task_gate_pipeline`
- higher-level dispatch workflows such as `task_auto_pipeline`

The gate/auto assets from [T20260419-0622-3] and [T20260419-0623] exercise real v2 constructs:

- `loop + break_when`
- `fan_out + fan_in`
- cross-iteration `session:` binding
- deterministic child-job dispatch

That seeded corpus is Activity / Job's executable reference documentation.

## 11. Concerns & Honest Limitations

### 11.1 Provider typing is broader than provider wiring

The `Provider` enum names `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `ollama`, and `openai_compat`, but HTTP transport currently wires only `claude`. The schema is broader than the runtime.

### 11.2 Tool enforcement differs materially by backend

HTTP agent loops enforce the tool allowlist inside Orbit. CLI agent loops emit an advisory event and rely on the provider harness.

### 11.3 Some structural controls are still literals

`LoopBlock.max_iterations` and `FanOutBlock.max_workers` are structural `u32`s, not templated expressions, so workflows must fork YAML to change them dynamically.

### 11.4 Validation is split across phases

Some bad shapes fail at load time, some at job preflight, and some during dispatch. The "where will this fail?" answer is not yet uniform.

### 11.5 The audit story is powerful but split

The v2 envelope tree lives in `.orbit/state/audit/v2_loop/`, HTTP loop details materialize lazily in `.orbit/state/audit/loop/`, and payload blobs live in `.orbit/state/audit/blobs/`. Reviewers still need to know the split layout. [T20260426-0519] moved these traces under `.orbit/state/` so top-level `.orbit/` stays for config, resources, tasks, graph artifacts, and the SQLite command-audit database; [T20260506-2] stopped creating empty loop JSONL files for runs with no loop-level events.

### 11.6 The substrate still leaks into the public product story

README frames tasks, jobs, and activities as substrate. The CLI and seeded assets still expose this layer because Orbit needs it to operate today.

### 11.7 Nearby comments still carry migration-era drift

Some module prose still reflects earlier phase names or pass ordering. orbit-core entrypoints and executor behavior are authoritative.

### 11.8 Historical run inspection belongs to the run surface

Read-only history does not need the same dependencies as live execution. [T20260423-0447] kept retired workflow runs observable without live assets, [T20260425-2010] removed workflow-specific history browsers, and [T20260426-0742] removed duplicate job-level inspection aliases. Current inspection belongs to `orbit run history -j <job_id>` and `orbit run show <run_id>`; `orbit job` is for catalog browsing and direct execution.
