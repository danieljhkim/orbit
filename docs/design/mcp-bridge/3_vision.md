# Orbit MCP — Vision

V1 is a skeleton: local stdio, direct SSH stdio, server-side resolution, one Core
dispatch boundary, and audit context. Future work should preserve that shape and
add complexity only for a demonstrated requirement.

## 1. Authorization in Core

The next security layer belongs in Core, not in the local proxy, client UI, or
tool advertisement path. A useful authorization design must first answer:

- What authenticated principal does the accepting server receive?
- How is that principal bound to a machine or operator?
- Which rules apply globally and which apply per workspace or operation?
- How are denials audited without creating a second dispatch path?

The v1 `caller_machine_id` and `caller_ip` fields are insufficient for enforcement.
The label is supplied by the caller and an IP address is neither stable nor a
machine credential. Possible inputs include SSH certificate principals, forced-
command metadata, or another server-verified identity, but no mechanism should be
chosen before the required trust model is concrete.

## 2. Better provenance

Audit records may eventually need the authenticated SSH principal, key fingerprint,
connection identifier, or proxy version. Each added field should have a clear
source of trust and retention purpose. Audit enrichment must not silently turn an
observational field into an authorization key.

## 3. Contract skew

Direct SSH can connect different Orbit versions. Standard MCP discovery already
lets the accepting server advertise its actual surface. Add explicit compatibility
negotiation only if mixed-version failures cannot be explained cleanly through
normal discovery and errors.

## 4. Other transports

SSH is appropriate while every supported remote has a shell and the same operator
controls both ends. A network MCP service would require Orbit-owned authentication,
session lifecycle, exposure hardening, and operational support. Do not add one
merely to avoid launching SSH.

## 5. Multi-host routing

V1 remains one chosen destination answering only from its own state. The
client-side proxy stays byte-transparent and does not relay a call onward.
That rule continues to describe **current behavior** in [`2_design.md`](./2_design.md);
this section does not claim a mux is implemented.

The proposed federated MCP surface is an **explicit exception** to those v1
no-relay / byte-transparent rules, **for the federated namespace only**. A mux
in front of operator-configured destinations may inspect a host-qualified
selector and forward the call to the encoded destination. Direct SSH stdio to
one chosen host is unchanged.

The exception does **not** admit automatic owner discovery, replication,
relays-as-product, or fleet placement. Those stay out. The contract is
[federated-mcp](../federated-mcp/specs/federated-workspace-mcp.md)
([ORB-11009], citing [ORB-11008]).

## 6. Evaluation gates

Any extension should preserve these properties unless the change explicitly
replaces them:

1. one canonical tool schema;
2. one authoritative accepting server;
3. one Core dispatch and audit boundary per tools/call, including unknown names;
4. no policy in byte-forwarding transport;
5. no client-side check required for correctness; and
6. a focused end-to-end test for local and remote context propagation.

Current behavior is described in [`2_design.md`](./2_design.md). The machine-
readable contract is [`references/conformance-v1.yaml`](./references/conformance-v1.yaml).

## Task References

- [ORB-11008] recorded federated MCP policy that this vision now excepts from v1 no-relay
- [ORB-11009] admitted the federated-namespace mux exception in §5 without claiming it is implemented
