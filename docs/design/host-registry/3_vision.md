# Host Registry — Vision

Keep the registry small: one durable local machine identity, one validated local workspace catalog, and one shared composition seam for opening Core runtimes.

## Stable direction

- Stable IDs remain logical and transport-free.
- Logical workspace records remain separate from machine-local checkout paths.
- Registry owns schema and persistence; orbit-cmd owns runtime composition.
- CLI, Web and MCP reuse those seams rather than implementing their own lookup rules.
- Malformed or future durable state fails closed without being overwritten.
- Remote transport reaches the accepting server; it does not make local registry state authoritative for another machine.

## Questions that require evidence

### Old database cleanup

Remove obsolete registry tables and code only through a migration-safe change. Their historical presence does not justify reviving a fleet control plane.

### Host rename recovery

The current two-file rename is ordered but not transactional. If stale owner display names become operationally significant, add a deterministic repair/check command or one recoverable journal before expanding rename semantics.

### Legacy catalog repair

Identity-bearing legacy catalogs with no explicit checkout role fail safely but lack an automatic inference path. A migration tool is justified only if real installations still carry that shape and the intended owner can be established without guessing.

### Authenticated authorization

If Core later authorizes remote calls, it needs an authenticated principal or grant separate from machine_id, host_id, caller IP and SSH audit labels. Existing registry and session fields must not be promoted into credentials by implication.

### Checkoutless operations

If a future operation truly needs no checkout, define a narrow server-owned API and persistence contract for it. Do not weaken RegisteredRuntimeFactory or make the SSH proxy perform placement and workspace logic.

### Schema evolution

New host or catalog schema versions need explicit forward migration, crash-safe writes, future-version rejection tests and rollback classification.
