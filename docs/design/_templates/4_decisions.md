# <Feature> — Decisions

Record non-obvious decisions here by title. Task references carry provenance; superseded decisions remain in place so their original reasoning stays legible. See [CONVENTIONS.md §4](../CONVENTIONS.md#4-decisions) for the admission rule and required `Cost:` line.

<!-- Copy ONE of the two blocks below for each new decision. Delete this comment in real docs. -->
