# <Feature> — Design

<!-- Scope paragraph: what this doc covers (the current implementation) and what
     it deliberately leaves to 3_vision.md or another feature. -->

## 1. <Mechanism>

<!-- Describe one mechanism: how it works today, the key types/files, the
     invariants it holds. Add as many numbered mechanism sections as needed. -->

## N. Concerns & Honest Limitations

<!-- MANDATORY final section. Name the known sharp edges, failure modes, and
     things deliberately left unsolved. A design doc with no limitations section
     reads as either incomplete or dishonest — do not omit it. -->
