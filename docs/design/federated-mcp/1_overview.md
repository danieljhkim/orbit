# Federated MCP — Overview

Federated MCP is a proposed caller-facing mux: one Orbit MCP namespace in front of operator-configured destinations (MCP or SSH remotes already chosen by the operator). It is not current v1 behavior, not a host-registry evolution, and not a fleet inventory. Direct SSH stdio to one chosen host remains the implemented remote path. [ORB-11008] recorded the policy; this folder is the implementable contract from [ORB-11009] (PR #1139), with review holes closed in [ORB-11010].

## 1. Motivation

A later implementation will otherwise invent a second ownership model, key selectors on renameable `host_id`, or ship a relay that mcp-bridge still forbids. The five-point policy recorded by [ORB-11008] is still right; it was not a routing contract, and it no longer lives as a list in host-registry vision. This feature names the mux, the selector, the capability/authority split, the list schema, and the mcp-bridge exception so implementation cannot guess them.

## 2. Core Concepts

- **Mux, not registry.** Destinations are operator-configured remotes. The gateway does not discover owners, register a fleet, or reinterpret a selector against its own local catalog.
- **Host-qualified selector.** Structured, caller-uninterpreted addressing token with normative encoding `hm_<id>/ws_*`. Keyed by stable `machine_id`, not renameable `host_id`. Callers copy the list `selector` field; they must not parse or construct the token.
- **Capabilities vs authority.** `control_plane` and `execute` map onto existing host-registry owner and replica checkout roles. The destination's local catalog role determines class; list advertisement is a hint that may lag. Destination Core refuses the other class; the gateway does not rewrite or fail over.
- **Split mutations.** The destination host is authoritative for runs, logs, and scheduler state. The declared control-plane authority is authoritative for task issuance and the coordination store. One control-plane per repository is operator configuration, not a mux check.
- **Live descriptors, fail closed.** Federated `orbit_workspace_list` is a new session-unbound shape (not a v1 extension) and includes unreachable hosts. Routing uses a single error precedence and live delivery.

## Task References

- [ORB-11008] — recorded the federated multi-host MCP policy inside host-registry and remote-access vision
- [ORB-11009] — turns that policy into this implementable design contract (PR #1139)
- [ORB-11010] — closes the PR #1139 review contract holes (INDEX row, tool class, advertisement vs catalog role, list shape, error precedence, competing authorities, selector wording)
