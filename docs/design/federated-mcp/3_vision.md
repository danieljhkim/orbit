# Federated MCP — Vision

Forward-looking only. The contract in [specs/federated-workspace-mcp.md](./specs/federated-workspace-mcp.md) is proposed and not shipped. These questions must not be fake-resolved in the spec; an implementation task answers them with evidence.

## 1. Open Questions

1. **Transport authentication.** What authenticated principal does a destination Core receive on a mux-forwarded call? Selector possession is not authorization. Existing registry and session fields (`machine_id`, `host_id`, `caller_machine_id`, `caller_ip`, SSH audit labels) must not be promoted into credentials by implication. A destination-side mechanism for the authorization half of this question is proposed in [specs/caller-authorization.md](./specs/caller-authorization.md): the destination declares each caller's ceiling and the caller's argv becomes a request. That spec is unimplemented, and proposing it does not answer this question — an implementing task closes it with evidence that a destination actually refuses an over-asking caller, and that the self-asserted `machine_id` it keys on has been separated from the authenticated identity it can be pinned to.
2. **Selector expiry.** Does a host-qualified selector remain valid across destination catalog edits, host re-init, and mux restarts, or does it expire? If it expires, what is the caller-visible error, and how does that differ from `stale_route`?
3. **Health freshness.** How old may host-reachability and checkout-health be when listed? Is the list a live probe, a cached projection with explicit freshness, or a last-known snapshot for unreachable hosts? The spec requires including unreachable hosts and requires routing to decide on live delivery rather than cached list health; it does not yet define probe cadence or staleness thresholds.
4. **Cloud coordination-store details.** The declared control-plane authority may later offload the coordination store. What is the persistence contract, how do execution-binding hosts refer to it, and how does destination Core still refuse task issuance locally without implying replication?

## 2. Prior Work

### Policy recorded in host-registry / remote-access

[ORB-11008] wrote the federated policy (one namespace, live descriptors, fail-closed routing, destination authority, no replica protocol) into host-registry and remote-access vision. That write-up is superseded as a contract home; those docs now cross-link here as a standing constraint. They no longer hold the five-point policy list.

### Host-registry catalog roles

Owner vs replica checkouts, `machine_id` vs `host_id`, and checkout-health as repo-root presence are live v1 catalog rules. This feature maps new nouns onto those roles instead of creating a parallel ownership vocabulary. See [host-registry 2_design.md](../host-registry/2_design.md). A workspace with absent `owner_machine_id` cannot advertise `control_plane`.

### mcp-bridge v1

v1 is one chosen destination, byte-transparent direct SSH stdio, and no Orbit process relaying onward. Current behavior stays in [mcp-bridge 2_design.md](../mcp-bridge/2_design.md). [mcp-bridge 3_vision.md §5](../mcp-bridge/3_vision.md) now admits this mux as a federated-namespace-only exception and still excludes automatic owner discovery, replication, relays-as-product, and fleet placement.

### Session authority is caller-asserted today

`orbit mcp serve --operator` decides an MCP session's authority from argv, resolved once at startup in `crates/orbit-mcp/src/remote/identity.rs`. On an SSH destination the caller writes that argv, so the destination currently makes no statement about which callers may reach a governed operation. [specs/caller-authorization.md](./specs/caller-authorization.md) proposes moving that statement to the destination. It is a separate axis from the `control_plane` / `execute` classes in [2_design.md §3](./2_design.md), which are already destination-derived.

### Remote access

Web SSH local-forward remains a different surface. Federated MCP must not reuse the Web tunnel, loopback dashboard, or attach/spawn lifecycle. See [remote-access](../remote-access/1_overview.md).

## 3. What May Be Distinctive

Nothing in the mux topology is novel: it is a configured reverse-proxy in front of existing MCP/SSH destinations. What may be distinctive for Orbit is refusing to turn that mux into a fleet product — selectors keyed on stable machine identity, capabilities mapped onto owner/replica, mutations split rather than blobbed, unreachable hosts listed rather than dropped, and no implicit failover to the owner.
