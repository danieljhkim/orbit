# Executors — Decisions

Layout note: as of [ORB-00400], this folder is intentionally decisions+specs-only.
[External Executor Protocol for dynamic out-of-process executor registration (retired)](#external-executor-protocol-for-dynamic-out-of-process-executor-registration-retired) and [specs/external-executor-protocol.md](./specs/external-executor-protocol.md)
are the load-bearing docs for the shipped External Executor Protocol; placeholder
`1_overview.md`, `2_design.md`, and `3_vision.md` docs would imply a broader
executor feature narrative that this work has not established. Add numbered docs
only when a future executor-architecture task owns that narrative, and retire
this exception in the same PR.

## External Executor Protocol for dynamic out-of-process executor registration (retired)

**Recorded:** 2026-06-14 00:40:41.791069Z · [ORB-00384], [ORB-10395]
**Paths:** `crates/orbit-types/src/workflow/executor_def.rs`, `docs/design/executors/**`

> **RETIRED 2026-07-26 — [ORB-10395].** The External Executor Protocol is not a supported Orbit surface. Retiring the v1 executor stack removed everything this decision stood up: `ExternalExecutor`, the shared `direct_agent` subprocess transport, `ActivityExecutorRegistry`, the `ActivityExecutor` trait, the v1 `ExecutionContext`, the `external.example.yaml` template, and the conformance fixture. v2 dispatch (`orbit-engine::activity_job`) is the only execution path and consults no executor registry, so an `executor_type: external` def is now inert — it deserializes and stores, but nothing spawns it. `ExecutorType::External` survives in the wire enum only so pre-existing defs keep parsing; dropping the variant is a separate release decision, tracked alongside the same call for `ExecutorType::AgentCli`. The Consequences below are history, not live obligations — in particular the wire protocol is **no longer** a backward-compatibility obligation. Any future out-of-process extension point must be decided afresh against the v2 dispatch path.

**Context.** Orbit's `ExecutorType` is a sealed enum and `load_from_defs` is a closed `match`, so a homegrown executor can only be added by forking orbit-engine — an `internal`-tier crate with no downstream guarantees. Yet `DirectAgentExecutor` already implements an out-of-process transport (spawn `command`, write a prompt envelope to stdin, map a stdout result envelope to an outcome): the capability exists but is undocumented and coupled to the agent-family `direct_agent` path.

**Decision.** Promote that transport into a documented, versioned **External Executor Protocol v1** and expose it through a new `ExecutorType::External` (wire value `external`). A homegrown executor is registered by dropping a YAML executor def that points at a binary/script speaking the protocol — no recompile, no linking, language-agnostic. In-process Rust extension (an `ExecutorFactory` registry plus a runtime injection seam) is explicitly deferred to a separate Tier 2 decision.

**Consequences.**
- Most homegrown executors become config-only: a YAML def plus a conforming binary, with zero changes to Orbit.
- The stdin/stdout envelope becomes a stability commitment — once v1 ships, the request/result shape is a contract that must be versioned, not changed in place.
- `external` reuses the existing `FsProfile`→sandbox path, so dynamic registration does not widen the sandbox-bypass surface relative to `direct_agent`.
- Executors needing a non-subprocess transport (in-process SDK, gRPC, internal queue) are NOT served by Tier 1 and must wait for Tier 2.
- Cost: a documented wire protocol is a long-lived backward-compatibility obligation — every future executor capability must be expressible as an additive, versioned envelope field, and a conformance harness must be maintained so adopters do not silently depend on undocumented behavior.

## Retire the External Executor Protocol v1

**Recorded:** 2026-07-25 22:59:08.214884Z · [ORB-10395]

### Context

The v1 runtime-host phase-out (knowledgebase/polaris/design/orbit-cleanup/phaseoutv1.md, Stage 3) deletes the v1 executor stack once planning duel is ported to v2 (ORB-10393). `ExternalExecutor` implements the External Executor Protocol v1 — a documented public extension point (docs/design/executors/specs/external-executor-protocol.md, [External Executor Protocol for dynamic out-of-process executor registration (retired)](#external-executor-protocol-for-dynamic-out-of-process-executor-registration-retired), assets/executors/external.example.yaml) — and shares the `direct_agent` subprocess transport slated for deletion. The phase-out design flagged an open question: if external executors remain a supported surface, the transport must be rehomed rather than deleted.

### Decision

Daniel decided on 2026-07-25: the External Executor Protocol is not a supported surface and is retired. `ExternalExecutor` and the shared `direct_agent` transport are deleted with the rest of the v1 executor stack in Stage 3 (ORB-10395); nothing is rehomed. The protocol spec doc and example asset are marked retired/removed in the same change, and [External Executor Protocol for dynamic out-of-process executor registration (retired)](#external-executor-protocol-for-dynamic-out-of-process-executor-registration-retired) is superseded by this record.

### Consequences

- Stage 3 becomes a pure deletion with no transport-rehoming work; the v1 executor stack (~1,000+ LOC) drops out in one gated task.
- Any out-of-tree executor built against the protocol stops working; there are no known consumers, and the removal is noted in release notes.
- Cost: re-introducing an external-executor extension point later means designing a new protocol against the v2 pipeline from scratch rather than reviving this one.

## Task References

- **[ORB-00384]** — External Executor Protocol v1: define the contract, add `ExecutorType::External`, register a generic external-process executor, document the spec, ship a conformance test.
- **[ORB-00400]** — recorded the `executors` folder as a decisions+specs-only layout exception while refreshing design-doc ownership conventions.
- **[ORB-10395]** — retired the External Executor Protocol with the rest of the v1 executor stack: deleted `ExternalExecutor`, the shared subprocess transport, the executor registry, the example def template, and the conformance fixture.
