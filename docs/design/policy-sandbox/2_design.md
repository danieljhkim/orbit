# Policy & Sandboxing — Design

This document describes Orbit's shipped policy and sandboxing implementation: v2 `PolicyDef`, profile resolution, last-match-wins path evaluation, HTTP-tool enforcement, activity/job `fsProfile` binding, macOS and Linux CLI sandbox wrapping, and `orbit-exec` supervision. See [1_overview.md](./1_overview.md) for purpose and [3_vision.md](./3_vision.md) for forward-looking gaps.

---

## 1. Policy Schema

`PolicyDef` in `crates/orbit-common/src/types/policy_def.rs` is v2-only. `crates/orbit-common/src/types/resource.rs` rejects schema v1 with a migration message that names `spec.denyRead`, `spec.denyModify`, and `spec.fsProfiles`.

A valid policy declares `name`, optional `description`, global `denyRead` / `denyModify`, and `fsProfiles` mapping names to `FsProfile { read, modify }`. The policy name must also pass the centralized resource-name validator in `crates/orbit-common/src/types/resource.rs`: it is a non-empty single file stem, not a hidden dot name, and contains no separators, traversal markers, drive-prefix characters, extension dots, or control characters ([T20260509-28]). File-backed stores validate before constructing `<name>.yaml` paths.

`PolicyDef::validate` enforces:

1. The policy name is a safe resource file stem.
2. Every profile name is non-empty.
3. Every positive `modify` rule is covered by a positive `read` rule in the same profile.
4. Profile rules do not exactly duplicate global deny entries.
5. `denyRead` never contains exceptions. A `denyModify` exception uses `!<path>`, names an exact path or `<path>/**` subtree, and is strictly contained by an earlier deny in the same policy.

`PolicyDef::merged(global, workspace)` lets workspace `fsProfiles` overwrite globals by name while global denies accumulate. A workspace may repeat or narrow a host `denyModify` exception, but cannot introduce an exception outside the host exception surface. Workspace denies are appended after host exceptions and therefore can narrow them. The merged policy is revalidated.

The shipped default expresses the versioned Orbit boundary as an ordered `.orbit/**` deny followed by exceptions for `.orbit/auto_tasks/**`, `.orbit/routines/**`, `.orbit/config.yaml`, `.orbit/config.toml`, and `.orbit/resources/**`. The broad deny continues to cover `.orbit/state/**`, task/learning/ADR/friction stores, databases, locks, and any future or misspelled `.orbit` path. Task `context_files` remain planning and conflict selectors; policy resolution does not convert them into filesystem grants ([ORB-10560]), and anchor materialization does not consult them at all ([ORB-10602]).

---

## 2. Profile Resolution

`PolicyDef::effective_profile(profile_name)` returns a `ResolvedFsProfile { name, read, modify }` after applying three transformations:

1. **Lookup.** Use the named profile. If the missing name is `unrestricted`, synthesize `read: ["./**"]` and `modify: ["./**"]`; other missing profiles return `OrbitError::InvalidInput`.
2. **Normalization.** Trim, convert backslashes, strip leading `./`, reject absolute, `~`, and parent-traversal rules, then compile the narrow glob syntax to regex.
3. **Deny injection.** Append `denyRead` to `read` as negated rules. Walk `denyModify` in order: ordinary entries append as negated rules, while `!<path>` entries are host exceptions. An exception is intersected with the selected profile, so an empty/read-only profile gains nothing and profile negative rules still narrow the result.

The implicit `unrestricted` profile appears only when an activity omitted `fsProfile:` and the policy did not define `unrestricted`. A real profile with that name shadows the fallback.

---

## 3. Path Evaluation

`PolicyDef::check_path(profile, op, path)` returns an `FsCheckResult { allowed, matched_rule }`. The algorithm:

1. Resolve the profile (via §2).
2. Pick the rule list by operation (`read` or `modify`).
3. If the list is empty, deny with `matched_rule = "[]"`.
4. Walk rules in order and record the most recent match against the normalized workspace-relative path. Later matches override earlier ones.
5. Use the last match's negation flag. If no rule matched but a positive rule exists, deny with `<no matching rule>`; if only negated rules exist, deny with `[]`.

Path normalization (`normalize_path`) trims, flips slashes, strips `./` prefixes, and rejects absolute paths, `~`-anchored paths, and parent-directory traversal anywhere in the component list ([T20260509-27]). Tool callers are expected to canonicalize first and then express the path workspace-relative — `crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/fs/mod.rs::workspace_relative_path` handles that on the call site.

The glob translator supports `*`, `**`, `?`, and `<prefix>/**`. It is intentionally narrower than POSIX glob syntax.

---

## 4. PolicyEngine Facade

`crates/orbit-policy/src/lib.rs` re-exports `PolicyEngine`, `FsPolicyEvaluation`, and `PolicyDecision`. `PolicyEngine` wraps a validated `PolicyDef` and exposes:

```
PolicyEngine::check(profile, operation, path) -> FsPolicyEvaluation
```

`FsPolicyEvaluation` carries `{ profile, operation, path, allowed, matched_rule }`. `evaluator.rs` currently passes through to `PolicyDef::check_path`; the indirection leaves room for caching or layered evaluators later.

`PolicyDecision` (`crates/orbit-common/src/types/policy_decision.rs`) is a separate `Allow | Deny { reason }` enum for broader policy/RBAC callers. `PolicyEngine::check` does not produce it; fs callers use `FsPolicyEvaluation`.

---

## 5. Tool-Layer Enforcement

`crates/orbit-tools/src/builtin/fs/mod.rs::enforce_fs_policy` is the only place fs operations consult the policy engine today. It reads `ctx.fs_profile` and `ctx.policy_engine`; if either is missing, it returns `Ok(None)` so fs work proceeds unguarded. That path is for unit tests / no-policy contexts, not the real v2 host path. Otherwise the helper converts the canonical path to workspace-relative form, calls `policy_engine.check`, emits a request or denied `FsCallEvent`, and returns either an `FsPolicyAllowance { profile, op, path, matched_rule }` or `OrbitError::PolicyDenied`.

The audit emission goes through `ctx.fs_audit: Option<Arc<dyn FsAuditLogger>>` (`crates/orbit-tools/src/lib.rs`). The v2 dispatcher wires this to `v2_fs_audit_logger(audit.clone())`, which converts each `FsCallEvent` into a `V2AuditEvent` filesystem entry. The full audit-channel description belongs to [auditability](../auditability/2_design.md#3-tool-driven-and-runtime-audit-records); this folder owns the *enforcement* contract, not the storage contract.

`FsCallEvent` carries `{ kind, profile, op, path, allowed, matched_rule }`. There is no persisted negation flag; consumers that need to distinguish explicit deny matches from "no rule matched" must compare `matched_rule` with the policy denies. The exec layer does not consult the policy engine, so there is no `proc.spawn` policy gate today.

**Backend scope.** This enforcement fires only under `backend: http` when a builtin fs tool runs. `backend: cli` spawns Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini, or another harness via `cli_runner.rs`, emits `tool_allowlist.harness_delegated`, and trusts that harness for tool allowlists. On macOS, executors declaring `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` also get the OS-level wrapper in §7, so `fsProfile:` can still narrow CLI filesystem writes.

On Linux, shipped agent executors declare `linux-bwrap`. The wrapper enforces writes from the resolved `modify` policy but deliberately records reads as `read_delegated`; this is not general read-allowlist parity.

---

## 6. Activity / Job fsProfile Binding

The `fsProfile:` field on an activity flows through `crates/orbit-engine/src/activity_job/`:

- `dispatcher.rs` carries `fs_profile: Option<&str>` on `DispatchInput` and threads it into `run_activity_job_dispatch`, `run_loop_step_dispatch`, and `run_agent_loop_via_driver`.
- `job_executor.rs` reads `t.fs_profile.as_deref()` from the activity spec at the call site of every step type.
- `agent_loop_driver.rs` invokes `host.tool_context_for_activity(fs_profile, audit_logger)` to construct the `ToolContext` that fs builtins read from.

`crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/v2_host/mod.rs::tool_context_for_activity` is the single materialization point:

```
fs_profile: Some(fs_profile.unwrap_or(UNRESTRICTED_FS_PROFILE).to_string())
```

This is the implicit-`unrestricted` rule from §2.2 in code form. Every v2 dispatcher path that constructs a `ToolContext` reaches this line, so omitting `fsProfile:` means "unrestricted within policy," not "no policy."

Legacy pipeline contexts are different. `crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/tool_exec.rs` fills a missing profile from `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_FS_PROFILE`; if the variable is unset, `ctx.fs_profile` stays `None` and `enforce_fs_policy` returns `Ok(None)`. That unguarded path is a real gap, not another spelling of `unrestricted` (see §9).

---

## 7. Sandbox / Exec Primitives

`orbit-exec` is the process-spawn layer. The public surface is in `crates/orbit-exec/src/lib.rs`:

- `ExecRequest { program, args, current_dir, timeout_ms, stdin_mode, environment_mode, debug }`.
- `EnvironmentMode::Inherit` or `ClearAndSet(Vec<(String, String)>)`; debug output redacts sensitive env values.
- `StdinMode::Inherit` / `Null` / `Bytes(Vec<u8>)`.
- `Sandbox::validate(req) -> Result<()>`; the default `NoSandbox` always returns `Ok`.
- `run_process(req, sandbox) -> ExecutionResult`.

`run_process` calls `sandbox.validate`, then `process::spawn`, then `supervision::wait_with_optional_timeout`. Spawn applies the requested environment, pipes stdout/stderr, and on Unix calls `command.process_group(0)` so cleanup can kill orphan subprocesses.

`ExecutionResult { success, stdout, stderr, exit_code, duration_ms, output }` is defined in `orbit-common`. Captured bytes use `String::from_utf8_lossy`, so non-UTF-8 output becomes replacement characters instead of failing the call.

The `Sandbox` trait remains the seam for generic `run_process` callers, but CLI-backed `agent_loop` invocations use a separate executor wrapper when the executor declares `sandbox: macos-sandbox-exec` ([T20260427-51]). The v2 host resolves the activity `fsProfile`; the engine converts workspace-relative rules to absolute roots and compiles SBPL before spawning the provider CLI.

The macOS wrapper resolves `sandbox-exec` from trusted absolute locations only, currently `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`; it does not consult `PATH` for either availability checks or process spawn. If the trusted binary is missing, the runner fails closed unless the executor declares `allow_fallback: true`, and the error names the trusted location that was probed ([T20260509-30]).

The compiled macOS profile denies by default, allows broad reads required by agent CLIs and system libraries, allows process/signal/ipc/network/sysctl/iokit operations, and allows writes to:

- scratch/cache roots (`/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/private/var/folders`, `/dev`, `$HOME/Library/Caches`)
- `$HOME/.orbit/state/logs` for early inherited Orbit subprocess logging before runtime root resolution
- provider state dirs: Codex (`$CODEX_HOME` or `$HOME/.codex`), Claude (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `$HOME/.claude`), Gemini (`$HOME/.gemini`), and Grok (`$HOME/.grok`)
- Claude `$HOME/.claude.json` sibling files (`.claude.json`, `.claude.json.lock`, atomic-write `.claude.json.tmp.<pid>.<ms_ts>`) when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is unset, since these live at the home root rather than under `$HOME/.claude/` ([T20260508-13])
- positive `modify` roots from the resolved profile
- Codex side-write roots from runtime provider config, appended after policy denies so workflow state remains writable under the outer sandbox
- narrow child Orbit runtime roots appended by the v2 host after policy denies: global logs, global `orbit.db*`, global tasks, workspace `.orbit/tasks/**`, workspace `.orbit/frictions/**`, workspace audit/logs, and workspace semantic DB sidecars

The child Orbit runtime roots are deliberately narrower than the workspace `.orbit` tree. They cover stores used by currently activity-exposed Orbit write tools: task/review/artifact writes under `.orbit/tasks/**`, friction reporting under `.orbit/frictions/**`, and startup/runtime audit, log, semantic-index, and global database writes. Generic agent-callable state writes were removed in [ORB-10738]; graph write roots and every unlisted or future store remain outside this inventory.

`agent_implement` also exposes `orbit.adr.add` and `orbit.adr.update` ([ORB-10596]). On Linux, only the active managed worktree's `.orbit/adrs/proposed` and `.orbit/adrs/.locks` directories are bind-mounted writable after the enclosing worktree `.orbit/**` read-only mount; Accepted/Superseded ADRs and learning, task, state, and unknown local stores remain read-only. Allocation still uses the workspace-shared semantic database and `.id_alloc.lock`, so simultaneous worktrees serialize ID selection while each Proposed body lands under `<job-worktree>/.orbit/adrs/proposed/<id>/`. The allocator records that worktree-relative body path, allowing an orchestrator runtime to resolve and search it as a federated artifact while the worktree is live. macOS already re-allows the active job worktree as a whole after the policy deny, so this change adds no macOS SBPL allowance and changes no policy YAML.

Creation remains Proposed-only. In a managed-run context, `orbit.adr.update` may correct the title, body, and metadata of a Proposed record, but it cannot transition lifecycle status or modify an Accepted record. Acceptance and historical correction remain separate unmanaged human/orchestrator actions. A hub-side allocator or a second pending-decision queue was rejected: the existing shared allocator and federated artifact resolution already provide collision safety and discovery, while another protocol would duplicate allocation and introduce a second promotion lifecycle.

Negated `read` / `modify` rules become explicit SBPL denies in resolved order. Explicit host-policy exceptions and host-owned runtime roots appear after the enclosing deny, preserving last-match-wins without opening unrelated siblings. Simple path and `/**` subtree denials compile to `subpath`; non-subpath globs such as `**/*.env` compile to `regex`.

### 7.1 Linux Bubblewrap backend

On Linux, `ExecutorSandboxKind::LinuxBwrap` resolves only `/usr/bin/bwrap` and runs a real capability probe using the same private user, PID, IPC, and UTS namespaces plus mount setup required by provider execution. Absence or probe failure is permanent and fail-closed unless the executor explicitly sets `allow_fallback: true`. The availability decision happens before provider argv construction: an active outer wrapper neutralizes provider-native sandbox flags, while a bare fallback preserves them.

The deterministic argv starts with a read-only bind of `/`, explicitly retains the host network namespace, and applies canonical `modify` mounts in policy order. Broad positive roots are mounted before denials. A positive exact/subtree root is mounted after an earlier deny only when it is strictly nested beneath that denied root; equal or ancestor positives cannot mask the protection. This implements versioned-config and trusted runtime-store re-allows while unknown `.orbit` children remain read-only. A re-allowed file or directory must already exist because Bubblewrap cannot bind-mount a nonexistent child beneath a read-only parent; §7.1.1 covers how absent anchors are materialized, and a narrow re-allow that still cannot be mounted is returned on the plan's dropped-grant list rather than discarded. `/dev`, `/proc`, and `/tmp` are replaced with private minimal mounts, the wrapper creates a fresh session, and parent-death cleanup remains enabled.

The ADR authoring exception follows that same ordering: trusted host setup ensures only `<active-worktree>/.orbit/adrs/{proposed,.locks}` exists, then mounts those exact directories writable after the local `.orbit/**` deny. The ADR parent and its Accepted/Superseded lifecycle directories remain read-only. This does not add a policy exception, does not re-allow the shared workspace ADR tree, and does not expose any sibling under the worktree-local `.orbit` directory.

#### 7.1.1 Write-grant anchors are derived from the effective profile at each spawn

`spawn_linux_bwrap` prepares mount anchors immediately before compiling argv, from the same `ResolvedFsProfile` that compiles it. The grant set is every positive exact/subtree `modify` rule that is a narrow re-allow beneath an earlier deny and remains writable at its anchor after the full ordered rule list is evaluated. A later deny covering the anchor therefore prevents materialization, while a narrower deny below a writable subtree leaves the remaining subtree grant intact. Broad writable roots are excluded; they are host-owned and must already exist, so an absent one still fails closed at compile.

The policy grammar is the explicit anchor-type contract: an exact rule denotes a file, while `<root>/**` denotes a directory subtree. Filename punctuation is never type evidence, so an extensionless exact rule materializes a file and a dotted subtree root materializes a directory without any hardcoded path inventory. An existing target whose filesystem type contradicts its rule fails closed.

Creation is confined to the canonical managed worktree, which is trusted and disposable. Every worktree-owned component is checked for symlinks before both existing- and absent-target handling, the resolved existing anchor (or newly created parent) must remain inside the canonical root, and files use create-new semantics. Anchors outside that root are the host's to create and are reported, not invented. Creating an anchor grants nothing new — the final effective profile already decided the path is writable — so this is materialization, not policy.

Two consequences follow from deriving at spawn rather than during `worktree_setup`. The grant set matches the profile the kernel will enforce, including the host-appended run roots that setup never saw; and it is recomputed for each provider launch, so a run whose needs grow does not depend on a snapshot taken before it started. After a failed Bubblewrap child, the executor inspects EROFS stderr that names an attempted path and evaluates that path against the same effective profile, replacing a generic nonzero-exit message with an Orbit-owned missing-grant or shadowing-deny diagnostic. Children that omit the path retain the generic failure. [ORB-10602] [ORB-10607] [ADR-0329]

The policy syntax remains schema v2. Existing policies without `denyModify` exceptions retain their prior behavior. After installing a binary that carries a changed shipped default, `orbit init` refreshes the machine-global policy assets without changing executor sandbox selection or `allow_fallback`; `--force` is unnecessary and would reset the global root. Workspace policy can then narrow the refreshed host boundary but cannot expand its exception surface.

Existing matches of non-subtree negative globs are mounted read-only before spawn. Because mount namespaces cannot reject a matching filename created later, direct invocations with an overlapping non-subtree deny fail closed. An Orbit-managed single-writer worktree may run with snapshot expansion, followed by a post-run scan that rejects any newly-created forbidden match before downstream commit. Audit metadata records the effective backend, trusted wrapper, probe outcome, redacted effective argv, `write_enforced` or `write_delegated`, and the honest `read_delegated` boundary. [ORB-10552] [ADR-0304]

Bubblewrap's private PID namespace also establishes a liveness-authority boundary. A nested
`orbit` command receiving both truthy `ORBIT_MANAGED_RUN_CONTEXT` and a non-blank
`ORBIT_RUN_ID` is a managed child, not an authority for its host pipeline worker. On runtime
open it skips only the opportunistic orphan scan: the host worker can be alive while invisible
inside that namespace. Top-level runtime opens and explicit host recovery surfaces retain their
normal reconciliation behavior. Do not weaken the PID namespace, enable bare fallback, or infer
that an invisible host worker is dead from inside a sandboxed child. [ORB-10557]

### 7.2 Linux host readiness on Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) enables AppArmor restriction of unprivileged user namespaces through
`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`. When `/usr/bin/bwrap` starts Orbit's probe,
Bubblewrap creates the private user namespace and configures its UID map. If AppArmor has no
narrow profile granting that operation to Bubblewrap, the kernel rejects the setup and bwrap
reports `bwrap: setting up uid map: Permission denied`. A present executable is therefore not
enough; the real namespace-and-mount probe in `probe_bwrap` must succeed.

The supported Noble remediation is the distro `apparmor-profiles` package's
`bwrap-userns-restrict` profile. The package provides it under
`/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/`; copy it into `/etc/apparmor.d/` and load that copy with
`apparmor_parser -r`. Verify both that the profile is visible to AppArmor and that the exact
probe shape used by Orbit exits successfully:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --yes bubblewrap apparmor-profiles
test -x /usr/bin/bwrap
test -f /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict
sudo install -m 0644 \
  /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/bwrap-userns-restrict \
  /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
test -f /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict
grep -Fq 'bwrap-userns-restrict' /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles
/usr/bin/bwrap --die-with-parent --new-session --unshare-all --share-net \
  --ro-bind / / -- /bin/true
```

To roll back only this host remediation, unload the packaged profile with
`sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict`, then remove only the copied
`/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict` file; leave the package-managed source under
`/usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/` intact. The probe should then fail again on a host where the
global restriction is active, and repeating the copy-and-load sequence restores the remediation.
Do not disable
`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` globally or install a broad unconfined profile:
those changes expand the user-namespace attack surface beyond Bubblewrap. Do not set
`allow_fallback: true` to hide a failed probe, because that bypasses the fail-closed OS boundary
and runs the provider without `linux-bwrap`.

This subsection records the shipped Linux behavior from [ORB-10552] and the Ubuntu host rescue
context from [ORB-10553]. No sandbox design decision changed, and this operational remediation
requires no new ADR.

## 8. Process Supervision

`crates/orbit-exec/src/supervision/wait.rs::wait_with_optional_timeout` drains stdout/stderr in background threads, writes stdin bytes when requested, installs Unix SIGINT/SIGTERM handling, and polls `child.wait_timeout` every `WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL = 100ms`. Clean exits still call `kill_process_group(child.id())` to reap orphans. Parent signals terminate the group and report `exit_code = Some(128 + signal)` with annotated stderr; deadlines terminate with SIGTERM and append `process timed out`.

`crates/orbit-exec/src/supervision/cleanup.rs` is the termination layer. The escalation policy:

1. Send `SIGTERM` (or the supplied signal) to the entire process group via `killpg`.
2. Poll `process_group_is_alive(pid)` for up to `TERMINATION_GRACE_PERIOD = 5 seconds`.
3. If the group is gone, return success.
4. Otherwise send `SIGKILL` to the group, then call `child.kill()` and `child.wait()` to reap.

`process_group_is_alive` uses `killpg(pid, 0)`, treats `ESRCH` as "all gone," and treats other errno values as "still alive" so cleanup errs toward SIGKILL.

`SignalHandlerGuard` is RAII: install acquires a global `Mutex`, creates a pipe, swaps in handlers, and stores prior `sigaction` structs; Drop restores handlers, closes the pipe, and releases the mutex. The handler performs only an atomic load plus one-byte `write`, both async-signal-safe.

Non-Unix builds use a fallback `terminate_process_group` that just calls `child.kill().ok(); child.wait().ok();` — process-group semantics do not apply on Windows, so orphan reaping is best-effort.

---

## 9. Test surfaces

Risk-weighted regression tests sit beside the implementations they guard
([T20260509-7]):

- `crates/orbit-policy/src/engine.rs#tests` — `PolicyEngine::check` boundary
  semantics: positive read-rule matches return `allowed=true` with the rule
  recorded in `matched_rule`; modify paths outside any positive rule resolve
  to `allowed=false`; ordinary global `denyRead` / `denyModify` rules override
  profile-level positive rules under last-match-wins; an unknown profile name
  errors structurally (with the documented `unrestricted` exception); and the
  `matched_rule` field is populated for audit attribution. Traversal inputs
  such as `../secret.txt`, `src/../secret.txt`, and their backslash-normalized
  equivalents are rejected as `OrbitError::InvalidInput` for both read and
  modify checks ([T20260509-27]). The same surface proves host modify
  exceptions intersect profile authority, workspace exceptions cannot exceed
  the host surface, and later workspace denies still win ([ORB-10560]).
- `crates/orbit-exec/src/macos_sandbox/compile.rs#tests` and
  `crates/orbit-exec/src/macos_sandbox/tests/provider_dirs.rs` — trusted wrapper
  resolution ignores `PATH`, including a macOS runtime test that places a fake
  `sandbox-exec` earlier on `PATH` and verifies the fake wrapper is not
  executed ([T20260509-30]). SBPL compilation tests
  cover `denyRead` / `denyModify` clause emission (`subpath` for simple
  rules, `regex` for non-trivial globs) and resolved deny/re-allow ordering
  under last-match-wins. macOS-gated runtime tests
  (`compiled_profile_denies_reads_to_negated_read_path` and
  `compiled_profile_for_realistic_agent_loop_profile_allows_repo_writes_denies_dotenv`)
  exercise an `agent_loop`-shaped profile end-to-end against the kernel
  sandbox.
- `crates/orbit-store/src/file/policy_def_store/` — policy resource
  name tests reject traversal-shaped names such as `../x` before path
  construction and assert no file is written outside the policy store
  ([T20260509-28]).

macOS runtime tests skip where `sandbox-exec` cannot apply. Linux Bubblewrap
tests compile argv and exercise fail-closed/fallback behavior on every host;
kernel tests probe real `/usr/bin/bwrap` and skip with its concrete capability
failure when user or mount namespaces are unavailable. The Linux argv and
kernel cases also cover writable versioned `.orbit` paths versus protected
state, record, database/lock, and unknown paths ([ORB-10560]). Runtime-host
tests pin the managed-worktree ADR mount as the sole local record-store
exception, tool-host tests prove executors can refine Proposed ADRs but cannot
accept or rewrite Accepted records, and the SQLite allocator race test launches
two child processes with distinct worktree roots against one database/lock and
asserts 100 collision-free dense IDs per artifact kind ([ORB-10596]).

## 10. Concerns & Honest Limitations

1. **CLI read policy is delegated.** Both shipped OS wrappers confine writes, but Linux Bubblewrap intentionally keeps the host read surface available and neither backend replaces harness enforcement of arbitrary read globs.
2. **CLI tool allowlists are delegated.** The OS wrappers narrow writes, but Orbit still trusts Claude/Codex/Gemini/Grok harnesses for declared `tools:`.
3. **Provider state directories are trusted write roots.** `$HOME/.orbit` plus Codex, Claude, and Gemini state dirs are outside the activity workspace and emitted unconditionally.
4. **Codex side-root appends are config-coupled.** If Codex is configured without the workspace-write side roots, inherited Orbit subprocesses can hit `.orbit` write denials.
5. **macOS provenance syscall allowances are private.** `vnguard` and `Sandbox`/67 mirror current Codex startup needs and may require review after OS changes.
6. **Pipeline env fallback can leave `fs_profile = None`.** Legacy contexts without `ORBIT_ACTIVITY_FS_PROFILE` still bypass `enforce_fs_policy`.
7. **HTTP enforcement is helper-based.** A future builtin or non-builtin tool that skips `enforce_fs_policy` is unguarded.
8. **Generic exec has no policy hook.** `proc.spawn` program allowlists are activity-layer data, and `run_process + NoSandbox` remains unchanged; the OS wrappers attach only to CLI-agent dispatch.
9. **Symlink semantics are implicit.** `workspace_relative_path` follows symlinks and rejects out-of-workspace targets, but no spec states that invariant.
10. **Glob syntax is narrow.** Character classes, brace expansion, and POSIX bracket expressions are unsupported.
11. **Policy result shapes are parallel.** `PolicyDecision` and `FsPolicyEvaluation` have no bridge for future non-fs evaluators.
12. **Empty rule sets are safe but opaque.** A profile with only deny rules reports `matched_rule = "[]"`, not the matching deny rule.
13. **Signal handling is process-global.** `SignalHandlerGuard` serializes installs with a global `Mutex`, which constrains future worker-pool exec.
14. **Workspace canonicalization errors collapse to denial.** A missing workspace root can surface as `PolicyDenied("path is outside workspace")` rather than a clearer root-missing error.

- **[T20260509-7]** — Add `PolicyEngine::check` boundary tests and macOS sandbox `denyRead` / realistic agent-loop profile tests.
- **[T20260509-28]** — Validate policy and executor resource names as safe file stems before file-store path construction.
- **[T20260509-30]** — Resolve `sandbox-exec` from trusted absolute locations and keep availability errors fail-closed and explicit.
- **[ORB-00129]** — Re-allow narrow workspace child Orbit runtime stores for activity-exposed learning, friction, and job-run state tools without removing the default workspace `.orbit/**` deny.

- **[ORB-10553]** — Rescue the Ubuntu host prerequisite for the shipped Linux Bubblewrap probe.
- **[ORB-10560]** — Add host-policy modify exceptions for the explicit versioned `.orbit` surface while preserving protected stores and unknown-path denial.
- **[ORB-10573]** — Materialize only exact missing versioned-config anchors gated by both task scope and the effective host policy/profile before Linux provider launch.
- **[ORB-10602]** — Replace that table-and-selector gate with per-spawn derivation from the effective profile, and surface every unmountable grant against its path and rule.
- **[ORB-10596]** — Allow executor-authored Proposed ADRs through one narrow managed-worktree mount while preserving global allocation, federated discovery, and separate acceptance.
