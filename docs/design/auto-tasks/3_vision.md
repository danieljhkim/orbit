# Auto-tasks — Vision

Forward-looking directions for the primitive. Everything here is speculative and
deliberately unbuilt; the shipped surface is in 2_design.md.

## 1. Open Questions

1. **Cross-workspace scheduling.** Today the scheduler processes only the
   definitions of the workspace whose routine fired it. Should there be one
   host-level pass that fans out over every routine-source workspace's
   `auto_tasks/`, mirroring the routine sweep's discovery?
2. **Dispatch coupling.** A minted task lands in `backlog`; the orchestrator
   still triages/ships it. Should a definition optionally auto-dispatch its
   task (e.g. straight into `workflow_ship`) under a crew, or does that
   re-introduce the "periodic work is code" coupling auto-tasks removed?
3. **Retention / expiry.** Should a definition support a `max_open` or a
   sunset date so one-off recurring campaigns retire themselves?
4. **Observability depth.** Routine fires are visible on `/api/routines`, but
   per-definition history (which slots minted which tasks) currently lives only
   in the cursor's `last_task_id`. Is a fuller per-definition ledger warranted?

## 2. Prior Work

### Within orbit
- **Routines** (`docs/design/routines/`) — the scheduler machinery auto-tasks
  ride on (cron eval, fire records, host pinning, dashboard health).
- **qa-sweep** (ORB-10039) — a bespoke periodic sweep that auto-tasks generalize;
  qa-sweep V1 (ORB-10148) is the first auto-task definition.
- **Triage pipeline** (ORB-10129) — the closest existing "routine fires a job of
  deterministic steps" shape.

### External
- Cron / systemd timers — the "schedule + command" baseline; auto-tasks add
  catch-up collapse, dedupe, and a task-shaped payload.
- Temporal/Cadence schedules — durable, catch-up-aware recurring workflows; the
  collapse semantics here echo their "skip overlapping" backfill policy.

## 3. What May Be Distinctive

The payload is a **task**, not a command. A fire produces a first-class Orbit
task that flows through the normal lifecycle (triage, crew routing, review), so
the scheduler needs no privileged execution surface — the dedupe key is just the
task's provenance tag, and observability is the existing task + routine surfaces.

### Orbit-internal
- `docs/design/routines/` — scheduler substrate.
- ADR-0218 — the auto-task primitive decision.
- ADR-0217 — provider-neutral run budgets (no turn caps).

### External
- POSIX cron; systemd timer `Persistent=` (catch-up analogue).
