# Task Publication — Vision

Task publication should earn trust first as a one-way durability projection.
Offline mutation, automatic authority movement, and multi-writer convergence are
separate capabilities with different safety contracts; none is implied by an
orphan branch.

## 1. Open Questions

1. What default publication trigger and freshness objective are justified by
   observed task-loss and recovery needs: explicit command, post-workflow hook,
   scheduled routine, or a combination?
2. Should an explicit authority transfer carry the last publication generation
   as a fencing token, and what evidence must the old owner provide before the
   new owner can publish?
3. Is direct read-only rendering from fetched Git objects sufficient, or does
   offline inspection need a disposable indexed cache?
4. What corpus size or fetch-latency threshold justifies checkpoint compaction,
   a replacement ref, Git LFS, or an object-store attachment backend?
5. Should hosted Orbit reuse the publication manifest as an export format, or
   should hosted backup remain a separate API with different retention and
   authorization guarantees?
6. Which sensitivity checks can run deterministically across supported hosts,
   and should an unavailable scanner fail `include` publication by default?

## 2. Prior Work

### Orbit task artifacts

[Task Artifacts](../task-artifacts/1_overview.md) already separates structured
metadata, Markdown prose, append-heavy JSONL, and checksummed binary attachments.
That bundle is the publication unit; publication must not invent a parallel task
schema.

### Orbit task migration

`orbit task export` and `orbit task import` validate portable `tar.zst` archives,
restore attachment bytes, rebuild indexes, and make ID collision behavior
explicit. Publication should reuse those bundle and validation primitives while
keeping migration's `renumber` behavior out of same-authority recovery.

### Live remote access and federated routing

[Remote Access](../remote-access/1_overview.md) and
[Federated MCP](../federated-mcp/1_overview.md) preserve destination-host
authority while making remote state reachable. Publication complements them
when the owner is offline; it does not cache their health, capabilities, runs,
or live mutation surface.

### Retired task sync

The archived [Task Sync](../_archive/task-sync/1_overview.md) proposal used the
same orphan ref as a shared writable registry. It required online task mutations,
shared allocation, operation-aware replay, tombstones, and structured conflict
resolution. Task publication keeps the useful isolated Git transport but rejects
the multi-writer registry contract.

### Git-backed trackers and backups

Git-backed issue trackers demonstrate that structured records can travel through
ordinary refs. Snapshot and backup systems demonstrate a different lesson:
replication for recovery can remain one-way even when consumers exist on many
machines. Publication follows the latter ownership model.

## 3. What May Be Distinctive

Orbit can make a narrow distinction that Git-backed trackers often blur: a
portable Git tree need not be a shared writable database. The publication commit
is useful precisely because it is subordinate to one task authority and carries
enough provenance to refuse ambiguous recovery.

The same task bundle can therefore serve three roles without conflation:

- canonical mutable record on the owner;
- immutable publication snapshot on the remote ref; and
- validated recovery input on a consumer.

The transition between roles is explicit. No directory becomes authoritative
merely because it was fetched or restored.
