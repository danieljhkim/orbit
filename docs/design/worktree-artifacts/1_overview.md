# Worktree Artifacts — Overview

Historically, worktree artifacts let decision and learning body files travel with the branch that created them while preserving one shared ID authority for the repository. Tasks, audit, scoreboards, and allocator state stayed in the shared `.orbit/`; the now-retired body files lived in the current worktree's `.orbit/`.

## 1. Motivation

Linked git worktrees let agents work on several branches at once, but the old single-root artifact model wrote every ADR and learning body into the main checkout. That made a branch's code change and its knowledge artifacts land in different working trees, so agents could not stage the full change together.

The three-task sequence split this apart:

- [ORB-00199] exposed `shared_root` and `local_root`.
- [ORB-00200] moved ADR and learning ID allocation into a shared SQLite allocator and migrated learnings to `L-NNNN`.
- [ORB-00201] writes ADR and learning bodies into `local_root` and reads them through allocation metadata.

## 2. Core Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Shared root | The main checkout `.orbit/`, used for tasks, audit, scoreboards, semantic.db, and allocation authority. |
| Local root | The current worktree `.orbit/`, used for ADR and learning body files. |
| Allocation row | A row in `id_allocations` recording ID, kind, allocation status, recorded worktree, branch, and `body_path`. |
| Local-readable artifact | An allocation whose recorded body path exists and can be read by the current process. |
| Remote stub | A list row for an allocation whose body is not locally readable, shown only with `include_remote`. Assumes the body still exists in *some* worktree. |
| Orphaned allocation | An allocation whose pinned worktree is gone from disk *and* whose body is unreadable everywhere locally — a remote stub that can never resolve again. Detected by the `id-allocations` doctor check and retired by `orbit doctor --fix-orphaned-allocations` [ORB-10501]. |

## 3. At a Glance

| Concern | File | Task |
|---------|------|------|
| Root split | `crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/resolve.rs` | [ORB-00199] |
| Allocator and body metadata | `crates/orbit-store/src/sqlite/id_allocator/` | [ORB-00200], [ORB-00201] |
| ADR body storage and federation | `crates/orbit-store/src/file/adr_store/api/` | [ORB-00201] |
| Learning body storage and federation | `crates/orbit-store/src/file/learning_store/api/crud.rs` | [ORB-00201] |
| CLI/tool remote listing | `crates/orbit-core/src/runtime/orbit_tool_host/` and `crates/orbit-cli/src/command/learning/` | [ORB-00201] |
| Orphaned-allocation detection and repair | `crates/orbit-core/src/command/id_allocation.rs`, `crates/orbit-cmd/src/doctor.rs` | [ORB-10501] |
| Pre-removal unique-body guard | `crates/orbit-engine/src/executor/automation/vcs/worktree/cleanup.rs` | [ORB-10535] |
| Decision log | `docs/design/worktree-artifacts/4_decisions.md` | [Worktree-local ADR and learning bodies with shared ID allocation](./4_decisions.md#worktree-local-adr-and-learning-bodies-with-shared-id-allocation), [Detect and retire id allocations pinned to a reaped worktree](./4_decisions.md#detect-and-retire-id-allocations-pinned-to-a-reaped-worktree) |

## Task References

- [ORB-00199] split Orbit runtime resolution into shared and local roots.
- [ORB-00200] introduced the global ADR/Learning allocator and `L-NNNN` learning IDs.
- [ORB-00201] moved ADR/Learning body writes to the current worktree and added read federation.
- [ORB-10501] added detection and guarded repair for allocations pinned to a worktree that no longer exists.
- [ORB-10535] blocks automated worktree removal while a learning or ADR body is readable only in the target worktree.

Resolve any task above with `orbit task show <ID>` or `git log --grep=<ID>`.
