# Check Orbit Health

Use this runbook for local diagnosis, readiness monitoring, or verification after a restore,
database recovery, or upgrade.

## Run `orbit doctor`

`orbit doctor` performs infrastructure checks and one row for each definition-artifact kind.
Every check degrades to a row rather than aborting unless the store itself cannot open.

| Check | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `config` | layered config parses (`~/.orbit/config.toml` + workspace `config.toml`) |
| `database` | store DB `PRAGMA quick_check` + schema-ledger version versus this binary |
| `disk-space` | free space on the volume holding `.orbit` (warn below 1 GiB or 5%; fail below 256 MiB or 1%) |
| `semantic-index` | stale embedding rows; skipped if never indexed |
| `stale-locks` | `.lock` files under `state/`, `tasks/`, `learnings/`, and `adrs/.locks/` whose recorded holder PID is dead |
| `job-runs` | orphaned `pending` or `running` runs with no live worker process |
| `task-reservations` | active reservations whose owner run or terminal task association proves the reservation stale |
| `task-relations` | unresolved relation/dependency targets that would block a task-index rebuild |
| `artifacts-*` | skills, jobs, activities, auto-tasks, and routines on disk: stale, deprecated, residual, or catalog-invalid |

Example:

```text
$ orbit doctor
│ CHECK            STATUS    DETAILS                                                          │
│ config           ok        valid (~/.orbit/config.toml)                                     │
│ database         ok        quick_check ok; schema version 1 matches this binary             │
│ disk-space       ok        11.2 GiB free of 65.6 GiB (17.1%) on the volume holding …/.orbit │
│ semantic-index   skipped   no semantic embeddings indexed yet                               │
│ stale-locks      warning   1 lock file(s) left by dead holders (the OS already released     │
│                            the flock; safe to delete): …/state/layout.lock                  │
│                            (dead pid 154488, op: layout upgrade, since 2026-07-04T09:25…)   │
│ job-runs         ok        no orphaned job runs                                              │
│ task-reservations ok       no conclusively stale active task reservations                    │
│ task-relations   ok        no unresolved relation/dependency targets                        │
0 failure(s), 1 warning(s).
```

The command exits nonzero only when at least one check is `ERROR`; warnings and skips exit
zero. `--json` emits an array of objects with `check`, `status`, `message`, and `remediation`
fields; statuses are lowercase and `remediation` is `null` for healthy/skipped rows. Human
output prints the same guidance as an `Action:` line. Lock files flagged by `stale-locks`
include holder diagnostics and are safe to delete only after confirming the holder PID is dead.

### Repair stale task reservations

The `task-reservations` check is read-only and intentionally narrower than task-lock listing.
It warns only when Orbit can prove one of these conditions:

- the recorded owner run no longer exists;
- the recorded owner run is terminal;
- the existing run-owner classifier proves a pending/running owner orphaned; or
- an unowned reservation has one or more associated tasks and every one is `done`, Orbit's
  terminal task status.

Fresh reservations, reservations owned by live or inconclusively probed runs, and unowned
reservations with empty, missing, mixed, or non-terminal task associations remain untouched.
Each warning names the `reservation-…` id, its task/run context, the stale reason, and the exact
repair command:

```sh
orbit doctor --fix-stale-task-locks
```

The repair re-reads and reclassifies each candidate immediately before releasing it, uses the
normal task-lock release audit path with the `doctor_stale_task_lock` reason, and is idempotent.
This is distinct from `--fix-stale-locks`, which handles dead-holder filesystem `.lock` files.

There is deliberately no blanket `--fix` or resolve-all option. Configuration repair, database
recovery, job cancellation, graph cleanup, id-allocation retirement, filesystem lock deletion,
task-reservation release, and retired activity-backend cleanup have different evidence and
safety gates, so each repair remains explicit and safety-scoped.

### Repair retired activity backends

`artifacts-activities` uses the same load and tool-allowlist path as production activity
catalog construction, including workspace-local `.orbit/resources/activities/` files. A
schemaVersion 2 `agent_loop` activity that still declares `spec.backend: http` or
`spec.backend: auto` is a warning that names the file, the rejected field/value, the catalog
parse error, and one opt-in repair:

```sh
orbit doctor --fix-retired-activity-backends
```

The repair deletes only that obsolete `spec.backend` key, leaves unknown backend values and
unrelated malformed activities untouched (and reports them for a manual edit), and is
idempotent across every activity catalog directory in the workspace.

Graph is retired under [Retire and delete Orbit's code-graph subsystem](../design/_archive/orbit-graph/4_decisions.md#retire-and-delete-orbits-code-graph-subsystem) and is not inspected by ordinary health checks. To remove
leftover state explicitly, run `orbit doctor --remove-graph`. This deletes only the current
worktree's `.orbit/graph` and the shared workspace's `.orbit/knowledge/graph`; it is
idempotent when either is absent. Combine it with `--json` for a single JSON result with no
cleanup prose on stdout. Without `--remove-graph`, `orbit doctor` leaves both locations
untouched.

## Probe dashboard health

The loopback-only dashboard (`orbit web serve`, default `127.0.0.1:7878`) exposes liveness
and readiness:

```sh
curl -s localhost:7878/healthz                       # -> "ok"; cheap liveness, always 200
curl -s 'localhost:7878/healthz?detailed=true' | jq  # readiness; HTTP 503 if any check fails
```

Example detailed response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "workspaces_open": 1,
  "checks": [
    {"name": "sqlite_writable", "status": "ok",   "detail": "store database accepts writes", "workspace": "default"},
    {"name": "log_sink",        "status": "ok",   "detail": "~/.orbit/state/logs/orbit.jsonl accepts appends"}
  ]
}
```

Each detailed check is time-bounded to two seconds and runs per workspace.
`sqlite_writable` executes `BEGIN IMMEDIATE; ROLLBACK` without mutation. Point uptime
monitoring at the detailed form.

## Check the routine clock

Routines are Orbit's scheduling surface. Install or refresh the host clock with
`orbit routine init --install-clock`. Verify the native clock separately from routine due
state:

```sh
orbit routine clock status
orbit routine list
orbit sweep --json
```

On Linux, a healthy enabled status includes a finite next systemd trigger and an effective
cadence. `clock: unhealthy` with an inactive effective cadence means the timer is enabled but
elapsed, unscheduled, or could not be probed; follow the printed diagnostic and reinstall the
generated units with `orbit routine init --install-clock`. The generated timer schedules its
first sweep from each systemd user-manager startup and then recurs from service activation.
It does not replay every tick missed during host or manager downtime: on the next sweep,
routine `missed_run: catch_up_once` fires once for a gap while `skip` waits for the next natural
cron slot.

If an `overlap: forbid` routine remains `overlap_in_flight` after a restart, run one explicit
`orbit sweep --json` and inspect the referenced run. Sweep releases a dispatched in-flight
fire immediately only when the recorded owner process is conclusively gone; a live or
unprobeable owner remains protected until terminal or until the routine timeout. Use
`orbit doctor` and the stuck-job-run runbook below when the run itself remains orphaned.

The dashboard also exposes `GET /api/routines`. `qa-sweep` and other auto-task
definitions are ordinary workspace data under `.orbit/auto_tasks/`, processed by the
generic auto-task scheduler routine. The scheduler mints tasks from every due,
enabled definition; it does not itself edit docs, ADRs, learnings, friction records,
or comments.

## Verification and escalation

Record the exact failing check, full details, binary version, config path, workspace, and
relevant environment overrides before diagnosing. Use
[Recover a corrupted database](./database-recovery.md) for integrity failures and
[Recover stuck job runs](./stuck-job-runs.md) for orphaned-run findings.
