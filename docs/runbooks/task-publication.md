# Publish Orbit Tasks to a Dedicated Repository

Use this runbook to configure task publication for an owned workspace, publish a safe
snapshot, diagnose authentication or workspace-identity failures, or recover that snapshot
under the same authority.

Task publication is an explicit, task-only durability channel. It does not back up audit
events, run history, claims, reservations, configuration, host identity, or runtime caches.
No task mutation publishes automatically, and v1 seeds no publication routine. Keep the
global-root and database backups described in [Inventory and Protect Orbit State](./state-and-backup.md).

## Prerequisites and safety

Before binding a workspace, prepare:

- a registered local **owner** checkout, not a replica;
- one empty, dedicated Git repository for exactly one Orbit workspace;
- provider-side private visibility, collaborators, retention, and branch protection;
- working SSH or HTTPS credentials for that repository; and
- the logical workspace selector returned by `orbit workspace list --all --json`.

Orbit cannot prove provider-side privacy or erase retained Git history. Never reuse the source
repository as the publication destination, put credentials in the remote URL, or assume that a
private repository makes every attachment safe to publish.

Set these shell variables to the real values for the operation:

```sh
ORBIT_WORKSPACE=ws_example
ORBIT_CHECKOUT=/path/to/source-checkout
ORBIT_PUBLICATION_REMOTE=git@example.com:backups/example-tasks.git
ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ID=pub_example_primary
```

Use the stable logical `ws_*` ID or registered workspace name for `ORBIT_WORKSPACE`. A linked
worktree or migrated checkout can use a different runtime task partition internally; that is
not a second logical workspace and is not a reason to rebind publication. Publication commands
honor the selected logical identity after ORB-11142.

## Inspect identity before mutation

Establish the binary, source repository, workspace registration, and existing binding before
changing anything:

```sh
command -v orbit
orbit --version
git -C "$ORBIT_CHECKOUT" remote get-url origin
orbit workspace list --all --json
orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" workspace publication show --json
```

The global `--workspace` option must precede `workspace publication` or `task publication`.
Continue only when the selected registration names the intended owner checkout and source
remote. A missing binding is expected during first setup.

## Choose durable authentication

### SSH

SSH is the simplest durable choice for unattended publication. Use a non-credential-bearing
SSH remote and verify that the current process can reach the Git host before binding. Agent or
key configuration remains an operator responsibility and must not be embedded in the binding.

```sh
git ls-remote "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_REMOTE"
```

An empty result with exit status 0 is valid for a new empty repository.

### HTTPS and a short-lived askpass bridge

Publication Git runs non-interactively with system and global Git configuration disabled. In
particular, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` means a credential helper installed only in the
ordinary global Git config—including one installed by `gh auth setup-git`—is not read.
Environment-level mechanisms such as `GIT_ASKPASS` remain available. Never add a token to the
remote URL or write one into a helper script.

For GitHub, the following temporary helper asks the authenticated `gh` CLI for the token at
invocation time. The helper file itself contains no credential:

```sh
ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS="$(mktemp)"
chmod 700 "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS"
trap 'rm -f "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS"' EXIT HUP INT TERM

printf '%s\n' \
  '#!/bin/sh' \
  'case "$1" in' \
  '  *Username*|*username*) printf "%s\n" x-access-token ;;' \
  '  *Password*|*password*) exec gh auth token ;;' \
  '  *) exit 1 ;;' \
  'esac' >"$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS"

GIT_ASKPASS="$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS" \
  git ls-remote "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_REMOTE"
```

Keep `GIT_ASKPASS="$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ASKPASS"` on every Orbit command that fetches or pushes
the HTTPS publication remote. The shell trap removes the bridge when the shell exits; remove it
manually when working in a shell without trap support. Use the provider's equivalent
credential command when the remote is not GitHub.

## Bind the publication repository

Bind from any checkout only when `--workspace` explicitly selects the declared owner:

```sh
orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" workspace publication bind \
  --remote "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_REMOTE" \
  --publication-id "$ORBIT_PUBLICATION_ID" \
  --branch refs/heads/main \
  --json

orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" workspace publication show --json
```

The binding is machine-local and records logical workspace, portable source identity,
publication remote, branch, publication lineage, and authority machine. It must not contain
credentials or checkout paths. The bind and show operations do not contact the remote; add the
temporary `GIT_ASKPASS` environment assignment later to publish, status, inspect, and restore
commands that use HTTPS.

Use `workspace publication rebind` only to deliberately replace the lineage. Use `workspace
publication remove --confirm` only to remove local binding and last-success state; neither
operation deletes or rewrites the remote repository.

## Publish safely

The attachment policy is an explicit exposure decision:

| Policy | Behavior | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fail` | Refuses the entire publication if any attachment exists. | First attempt and strict no-attachment workspaces. |
| `omit` | Publishes core task records plus an omission ledger. | Safe publication when attachments exist but are not approved. |
| `include` | Applies size and deny-pattern limits, then includes admitted bytes. | Only after deliberate content review and scanner policy approval. |

Start with the fail-closed default so Orbit inventories any blocking attachment without
publishing a partial policy choice:

```sh
orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" task publication publish \
  --attachments fail \
  --json
```

If known attachments are not approved for Git storage, publish only the core task records:

```sh
orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" task publication publish \
  --attachments omit \
  --json
```

V1 has no sensitivity-scanner integration. `include` still refuses attached bytes unless the
operator deliberately adds `--allow-unscanned-attachments`; repository privacy is not a
substitute for reviewing those bytes. If a secret ever reaches Git history, rotate the
credential and perform provider-side history remediation. Deleting it from the latest commit
is not erasure.

Publication uses an Orbit-owned cache. It does not check out, switch, stage, or change the
source-worktree branch.

## Verify the snapshot

After every publish, compare the owner-local success record with the validated remote tip:

```sh
orbit --workspace "$ORBIT_WORKSPACE" task publication status --json
```

Success has all of these properties:

- `state` is `current`;
- local and remote generation numbers match;
- local and remote commit IDs match; and
- `incomplete_attachments` matches the selected attachment policy (`true` after `omit`).

The first publish creates generation 1 and the configured branch in an empty repository.
Later publishes advance the same linear lineage with compare-and-swap semantics.

## Inspect and recover a publication

Inspection is read-only and does not require an owner-local publication binding. Supply the
expected pairing facts rather than trusting the repository to declare its own identity:

```sh
orbit --workspace <local-consumer-workspace> task publication inspect \
  --workspace-id <published-logical-workspace-id> \
  --source-remote <published-source-remote> \
  --publication-id <publication-id> \
  --authority-machine-id <authority-machine-id> \
  --remote <publication-remote> \
  --json
```

The result labels every record with publication time, generation, workspace, source identity,
authority, publication ID, commit, freshness, completeness, and `render_authority: snapshot`.
It is not live owner state. Pairing mismatch, unsupported schema, corrupt JSONL, changed bundle
or attachment bytes, or invalid Git lineage returns no trusted task projection.

Restore global configuration plus `host.toml` and `workspaces.json` authority evidence first.
V1 has no authority-transfer command: the selected recovery workspace must be an owner checkout
whose machine, logical workspace ID, and source remote match the publication. Start with an
empty canonical task destination:

```sh
orbit --workspace <recovery-logical-workspace-id> task publication restore \
  --workspace-id <published-logical-workspace-id> \
  --source-remote <published-source-remote> \
  --publication-id <publication-id> \
  --authority-machine-id <authority-machine-id> \
  --remote <publication-remote> \
  --confirm \
  --json
```

The confirmation is mandatory. The default refuses any non-empty destination. For an
interrupted or repeated recovery, `--allow-identical-retry` admits only byte-identical task-ID
collisions; one non-identical collision aborts the whole restore without renumbering or partial
replacement. Use ordinary `task export` and `task import` with renumbering for migration between
unrelated authorities.

## Diagnose failures

| Symptom | Check and response |
| --- | --- |
| Git reports that it cannot read a username, password, or terminal prompt. | Global credential helpers are intentionally isolated. Use SSH or pass a short-lived `GIT_ASKPASS` helper explicitly to the Orbit command. |
| A binding appears missing or belongs to another checkout. | Run `orbit workspace list --all --json`, then repeat `workspace publication show` with the intended logical `--workspace` selector before changing the binding. |
| The logical `ws_*` ID differs from an internal runtime task partition. | This is supported after ORB-11142. Keep selecting the logical workspace; do not rebind or rewrite task storage to make the IDs match. |
| The publication remote is rejected during bind. | Remove credentials from the URL, confirm it differs from the source remote, and use a dedicated repository. |
| First publication finds an unrelated or non-publication branch. | Stop. Provision an empty dedicated repository; Orbit will not adopt or overwrite unrelated history. |
| `--attachments fail` names one or more files. | Review the named files. Use `omit` for a core-record snapshot, or use `include` only after explicit exposure approval. |
| Status reports a moved branch or authority conflict. | Stop publishing and identify the unexpected writer or stale binding. Orbit will not merge or force-push the branch. |
| The registered checkout path is genuinely stale or invalid. | Restore or re-point the checkout and run `orbit workspace init --force` from the intended repository. A different runtime partition alone is not evidence of stale registration. |

If `workspace init --force` cannot reconcile a proven stale registration, preserve
`~/.orbit/workspaces.json`, capture `workspace publication show --json`, stop active Orbit jobs,
and escalate before removing the workspace registration. Deregistration can discard
machine-local publication binding and last-success evidence even though it does not delete the
repository's `.orbit/` directory or the remote publication history.
